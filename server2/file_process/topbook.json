            "text": "Chapter 0\nIntroduction\nTopology is an important and interesting area of mathematics, the study of which\nwill not only introduce you to new concepts and theorems but also put into context\nold ones like continuous functions.\nHowever, to say just this is to understate\nthe significance of topology.\nIt is so fundamental that its influence is evident in\nalmost every other branch of mathematics.\nThis makes the study of topology\nrelevant to all who aspire to be mathematicians whether their first love is (or\nwill be) algebra, analysis, category theory, chaos, continuum mechanics, dynamics,\ngeometry, industrial mathematics, mathematical biology, mathematical economics,\nmathematical finance, mathematical modelling, mathematical physics, mathematics\nof communication, number theory, numerical mathematics, operations research or\nstatistics. (The substantial bibliography at the end of this book suffices to indicate\nthat topology does indeed have relevance to all these areas, and more.) Topological\nnotions\nlike\ncompactness,\nconnectedness\nand\ndenseness\nare\nas\nbasic\nto\nmathematicians of today as sets and functions were to those of last century.\nTopology has several different branches — general topology (also known as point-\nset topology), algebraic topology, differential topology and topological algebra — the\nfirst, general topology, being the door to the study of the others. I aim in this book\nto provide a thorough grounding in general topology. Anyone who conscientiously\nstudies about the first ten chapters and solves at least half of the exercises will\ncertainly have such a grounding.\nFor the reader who has not previously studied an axiomatic branch of mathematics1\nsuch as abstract algebra, learning to write proofs will be a hurdle. To assist you to\nlearn how to write proofs, in the early chapters I often include an aside which does\nnot form part of the proof but outlines the thought process which led to the proof.\n1A useful introduction to Pure Mathematics is my YouTube video, http://youtu.be/veSbFJFjbzU.\n5\n1.3.\nFINITE-CLOSED TOPOLOGY\n45\n4. Let τ be the finite-closed topology on a set X. If τ is also the discrete topology,\nprove that the set X is finite.\nT0-spaces and the Sierpinski Space\n5. A topological space (X,τ) is said to be a T0-space if for each pair of distinct\npoints a, b in X, either2 there exists an open set containing a and not b, or there\nexists an open set containing b and not a.\n(i) Prove that every T1-space is a T0-space.\n(ii) Which of (i)–(vi) in Exercise 3 above are T0-spaces? (Justify your answer.)\n(iii) Put a topology τ on the set X = {0, 1} so that (X,τ) will be a T0-space but\nnot a T1-space. [The topological space you obtain is called the Sierpiński\nspace.]\n(iv) Prove that each of the topological spaces described in Exercises 1.1 #6 is\na T0-space.\n(Observe that in Exercise 3 above we saw that neither is a\nT1-space.)\nCountable-Closed Topology\n6. Let X be any infinite set. The countable-closed topology is defined to be the\ntopology having as its closed sets X and all countable subsets of X. Prove that\nthis is indeed a topology on X.\n2You are reminded that the use of “or” in mathematics is different from that in everyday\nEnglish. In mathematics, “or” is not exclusive. See the comments on this in Chapter 0.\n"

In English when you say that statement (a) or statement (b) is true,\nyou usually mean that statement (a) is true or statement (b) is true but not both .\nIn mathematics the meaning is different: the “or” is not exclusive.\nSo it means\nstatement (a) is true or statement (b) is true or statement (a) and statement (b)\nare both true. For example x ⩾2 or x ⩽2. In fact x ⩽2 and x ⩾2 are both true\nwhen x = 2. This mathematical usage can be misleading at first. For example when\nwe say “Either statement (a) or statement (b) is true” we mean either statement\n(a) is true or statement (b) is true or they are both true. So remember always that\nin mathematics, “or” is not exclusive.\nA recent addition to the Topology Without Tears book is Appendix 5 which\ncontains the material for a first graduate course on topological groups. In particular it\ncontains the beautiful Pontryagin-van Kampen Duality Theorem for locally compact\nabelian groups and a description of the structure of locally compact abelian groups.\nI first lectured this course at the University College of North Wales in Bangor in\n1974. The Inroduction to this Appendix 5 surveys the history of topological group\ntheory and some important material of the last few decades.\nThis book is typeset using the beautiful typesetting package, TEX, designed by\nDonald Knuth.\nWhile this is a very clever software package, it is my strong view\nthat, wherever possible, the statement of a result and its entire proof should appear\non the same page – this makes it easier for the reader to keep in mind what facts are\nknown, what you are trying to prove, and what has been proved up to this point in a\nproof. So I do not hesitate to leave a blank half-page (or use subtleTEXtypesetting\ntricks) if the result will be that the statement of a result and its proof will then be\non the one page.\nThere are many exercises in this book. Only by working through a good number\nof exercises will you master this course. I have not provided answers to the exercises,\nand I have no intention of doing so. It is my opinion that there are enough worked\n8\nCHAPTER 0.\nINTRODUCTION\n0.1\nAcknowledgments\nKluvanek\nHanna Neumann\nB. H. Neumann\nThe author must first acknowledge Dr Ian D. Macdonald who,\nat the University of Queensland, first introduced him in 1967 to\nthe subject of Topology and who also supervised in 1967/1968\nhis first research project on varieties of topological groups and\nfree topological groups, which later became the topic of the\nresearch for his PhD thesis at Flinders University. The author’s\nPhD was supervised by Professor Igor Kluvanek, who introduced\nhim to free compact abelian groups and to socialism, and who\ninfluenced the author’s approach to teaching mathematics as\ndid the author’s lecturers: Dr Sheila Oates Williams, Professor\nAnne Penfold Street, Professor Rudolf Vyborny, Professor Des\nNicholls, Professor Clive Davis and Dr John Belward at the\nUniversity of Queensland.\nThe author’s love of mathematics\nwas enhanced in 1963-1964 by Professor Graham Jones at\nCavendish Road State High School,\nand later enriched by\nProfessor Hanna Neumann and Professor Bernhard H. Neumann\nof the Australian National University.\nMacLane\nThe author’s understanding of category theory and its\nsignificance was developed through discussions with Professor\nGregory Maxwell Kelly of the University of New South Wales\nand Professor Saunders MacLane of the University of Chicago,\nUSA.\nThe author’s knowledge of Banach Space Theory and Topological Vector Space\nTheory was enhanced by discussions at the University of Florida in 1970 and 1971\nwith Joe Diestel and Steve Saxon.\nThe author has learnt a vast amount of mathematics from, and has had interesting\nand very useful conversations on the teaching of mathematics with, his coauthor\nProfessor Karl Heinrich Hofmann of the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany\nand Tulane University in New Orleans, USA.\nThe author’s love of Topology began with two books on Topology, namely Kelley\n[233] and Dugundji [113].\nPortions of earlier versions of this book were used at the University of New South\nWales, the University College of North Wales, La Trobe University, University of New\n10\nCHAPTER 0.\nINTRODUCTION\nNillsen\nParticular thanks go to Rodney Nillsen whose notes on\nchaos theory were very useful in preparing the relevant appendix\nand to Jack Gray whose excellent University of New South Wales\nLecture Notes “Set Theory and Transfinite Arithmetic\", written\nin the 1970s, influenced the Appendix on Infinite Set Theory.\nIn various places in this book, especially Appendix 2, there are historical notes.\nI acknowledge two wonderful sources Bourbaki [51] and The MacTutor History of\nMathematics Archive [392].\nKnuth\nInitially the book was typset using Donald Knuth’s beautiful\nand powerful TEX package.\nAs the book was expanded and\ncolour introduced, this was translated into LATEX.\nFor the\nlast 30 years most mathematics books and journals have been\ntypeset in some variety of TEX or LATEX.\nSandison\nAppendix 5 is based on my 1977 book2 ”Pontryagin duality\nand the structure of locally compact abelian groups”, Morris\n[293].\nThe 1977 book was based on a course I first gave in\n1974 at the University College of North Wales in Bangor, Wales,\nUK at the request of Professor Ronald (Ronnie) Brown and\nsubsequently delivered at the University of New South Wales in\n1975 and La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia in 1976.\nI am very grateful to Dr Carolyn McPhail Sandison of the\nUniversity of Wollongong, who as a present to me, typeset this\nbook in TEX for me, more than 15 years ago.\nSome photographs of mathematicians are included in this book.\nOften these\nare from Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org, and we gratefully acknowledge that\nwonderful source of information.

Mathematics is no different.\nSo we begin with the rules for topology.\nThis chapter opens with the definition of a topology and is then devoted to\nsome simple examples: finite topological spaces, discrete spaces, indiscrete spaces,\nand spaces with the finite-closed topology.\nTopology, like other branches of pure mathematics such as group theory, is an\naxiomatic subject. We start with a set of axioms and we use these axioms to prove\npropositions and theorems. It is extremely important to develop your skill at writing\nproofs.\nWhy are proofs so important? Suppose our task were to construct a building.\nWe would start with the foundations. In our case these are the axioms or definitions\n– everything else is built upon them. Each theorem or proposition represents a new\nlevel of knowledge and must be firmly anchored to the previous level. We attach the\nnew level to the previous one using a proof. So the theorems and propositions are\nthe new heights of knowledge we achieve, while the proofs are essential as they are\nthe mortar which attaches them to the level below. Without proofs the structure\nwould collapse.\nSo what is a mathematical proof?\n24\nChapter 2\nThe Euclidean Topology\nIntroduction\nIn a movie or a novel there are usually a few central characters about whom the\nplot revolves.\nIn the story of topology, the euclidean topology on the set of real\nnumbers is one of the central characters. Indeed it is such a rich example that we\nshall frequently return to it for inspiration and further examination.\nLet R denote the set of all real numbers.\nIn Chapter 1 we defined three\ntopologies that can be put on any set: the discrete topology, the indiscrete topology\nand the finite-closed topology. So we know three topologies that can be put on the\nset R. Six other topologies on R were defined in Exercises 1.1 #5 and #9. In this\nchapter we describe a much more important and interesting topology on R which is\nknown as the euclidean topology.\nAn analysis of the euclidean topology leads us to the notion of “basis for a\ntopology”.\nIn the study of Linear Algebra we learn that every vector space has a\nbasis and every vector is a linear combination of members of the basis. Similarly, in\na topological space every open set can be expressed as a union of members of the\nbasis. Indeed, a set is open if and only if it is a union of members of the basis.\nIn order to understand this chapter, you should familiarize yourself with the\ncontent of the first section of Appendix 1; that is A1.1. This is supplemented by the\nvideos \"Topology Without Tears - Video 2a & 2b - Infinite Set Theory\" which are\non YouTube at http://youtu.be/9h83ZJeiecg & http://youtu.be/QPSRB4Fhzko;\non Youku at http://tinyurl.com/m4dlzhh & http://tinyurl.com/kf9lp8e; and\nhave links from http://www.topologywithouttears.net.\n50\n70\nCHAPTER 2.\nTHE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY\n2.4\nPostscript\nIn this chapter we have defined a very important topological space – R, the set\nof all real numbers with the euclidean topology, and spent some time analyzing it.\nWe observed that, in this topology, open intervals are indeed open sets (and closed\nintervals are closed sets). However, not all open sets are open intervals. Nevertheless,\nevery open set in R is a union of open intervals. This led us to introduce the notion\nof “basis for a topology” and to establish that the collection of all open intervals is\na basis for the euclidean topology on R.\nIn the introduction to Chapter 1 we described a mathematical proof as a\nwatertight argument and underlined the importance of writing proofs. In this chapter\nwe were introduced to proof by contradiction in Remarks 2.1.2 (v) with another\nexample in Example 2.2.7. Proving “necessary and sufficient” conditions, that is, “if\nand only if” conditions, was explained in Proposition 2.2.1, with further examples in\nPropositions 2.2.8, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, and 2.3.4.\nBases for topologies is a significant topic in its own right. We saw, for example,\nthat the collection of all singletons is a basis for the discrete topology. Proposition\n2.2.8 gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a collection of subsets of a set X\nto be a basis for some topology on X. This was contrasted with Proposition 2.3.2\nwhich gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a collection of subsets of X to\nbe a basis for the given topology on X. It was noted that two different collections\nB1 and B2 can be bases for the same topology. Necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor this are given by Proposition 2.3.4.\nWe defined the euclidean topology on Rn, for n any positive integer. We saw\nthat the family of all open discs is a basis for R2, as is the family of all open squares,\nor the family of all open rectangles.\nThe exercises introduced three interesting ideas. Exercises 2.1 #8 covered the\nnotions of Fσ-set and Gδ-set which are important in measure theory.\nExercises\n2.3 #4 introduced the space of continuous real-valued functions. Such spaces are\ncalled function spaces which are the central objects of study in functional analysis.\nFunctional analysis is a blend of (classical) analysis and topology, and was for some\ntime called modern analysis, cf. Simmons [364]. Finally, Exercises 2.3 #5–12 dealt\nwith the notion of subbasis.\n10.3.\nTYCHONOFF’S THEOREM\n313\nCellularity\n31. Let (X,τ) be a topological space, the cellularity of the topological space (X,τ)\nis the cardinal number 8 c(X) given by\nc(X) = ℵ0 + sup{card U : U is a set of pairwise disjoint open sets in (X,τ).}\nThe density of (X,τ) is the cardinal number d(X) given by\nd(X) = ℵ0 + min{card S : S ⊆X and S is dense in X}.\nThe spread of (X,τ) is the cardinal number s(X) given by\ns(X) = ℵ0 + sup{card (D) : D is a discrete subspace of X}.\nThe Lindelöf degree, L(X), of (X,τ) is the smallest infinite cardinal number\nℵsuch that every open cover of X has a subcover of cardinality ⩽ℵ. Of course\nL(X) = ℵ0 if and only if (X,τ) is a Lindelöf space.\nWrite down and verify the obvious relations between cellularity, density, spread,\nLindelöf degree, and weight of any topological space (X,τ).\nG-bases\n32. Recall9 the definition of poset in Definition 10.2.1. A subset A of the poset P\nis said to be cofinal in P if for each x ∈P , there exists an a ∈A such that\nx ⩽a.\nA subset A of the poset P is said to be coinitial in P if for each x ∈P , there\nexists a b ∈A such that b ⩽x.\nA subset A of P is said to be bounded if there exists an x ∈P such that for\nall a ∈A, a ⩽x.\nA poset P is said to be lower complete if for every subset A of X has a greatest\nlower bound.\nThe cofinality of a poset P , denoted by cf(P ) is the least of the cardinalities\nof the cofinal subsets of P .\n8There are numerous cardinal invariants (cardinal functions) associated with each topological\nspace. We have introduced only 4 of these in this exercise. For more detailed discussion, see Juhász\n[222] and Chapter 1 of Kunen and Vaughan [248].\n9This exercise is inspired by the beautiful manuscript, Banakh [28].\nMost of the material here\nappears in that manuscript of Taras Banakh (1968– ).\n"

They are: S1 = Ø,\nS2 = {a}, S3 = {b}, S4 = {c}, S5 = {a, b}, S6 = {a, c}, S7 = {b, c}, and\nS8 = {a, b, c} = X.\nWe are required to prove that each of these subsets is in τ . As τ is a topology,\nDefinitions 1.1.1 (i) implies that X and Ø are in τ ; that is, S1 ∈τ and S8 ∈τ .\nWe are given that {a} ∈τ , {b} ∈τ and {c} ∈τ ; that is, S2 ∈τ , S3 ∈τ and\nS4 ∈τ .\nTo complete the proof we need to show that S5 ∈τ , S6 ∈τ , and S7 ∈τ . But\nS5 = {a, b} = {a} ∪{b}. As we are given that {a} and {b} are in τ , Definitions\n1.1.1 (ii) implies that their union is also in τ ; that is, S5 = {a, b} ∈τ .\nSimilarly\nS6 = {a, c} = {a}∪{c} ∈τ\nand\nS7 = {b, c} = {b}∪{c} ∈τ .\nIn the introductory comments on this chapter we observed that mathematics\nis not a spectator sport.\nYou should be an active participant.\nOf course your\nparticipation includes doing some of the exercises. But more than this is expected\nof you. You have to think about the material presented to you.\nOne of your tasks is to look at the results that we prove and to ask pertinent\nquestions.\nFor example, we have just shown that if each of the singleton sets\n{a}, {b} and {c} is in τ and X = {a, b, c}, then τ is the discrete topology.\nYou\nshould ask if this is but one example of a more general phenomenon; that is, if (X,τ)\nis any topological space such that τ contains every singleton set, is τ necessarily\nthe discrete topology? The answer is “yes”, and this is proved in Proposition 1.1.9.\n30\nCHAPTER 1.\nTOPOLOGICAL SPACES\nThat every set S is a union of its singleton subsets is a result which we shall\nuse from time to time throughout the book in many different contexts. Note that\nit holds even when S = Ø as then we form what is called an empty union and get\nØ as the result.\nExercises 1.1\n1.\nLet X = {a, b, c, d, e, f}.\nDetermine whether or not each of the following\ncollections of subsets of X is a topology on X:\n(a) τ 1 = {X, Ø, {a}, {a, f}, {b, f}, {a, b, f}};\n(b) τ 2 = {X, Ø, {a, b, f}, {a, b, d}, {a, b, d, f}};\n(c) τ 3 = {X, Ø, {f}, {e, f}, {a, f}}.\n2.\nLet X = {a, b, c, d, e, f}.

Precisely six of the above are true.]\n4.\nLet (X,τ) be any topological space. Verify that the intersection of any finite\nnumber of members of τ is a member of τ .\n[Hint. To prove this result use “mathematical induction”.]\n32\nCHAPTER 1.\nTOPOLOGICAL SPACES\n9.* Let R be the set of all real numbers.\nPrecisely three of the following ten\ncollections of subsets of R are topologies. Identify these and justify your answer.\n(i) τ 1 consists of R, Ø, and every interval (a, b), for a and b any real numbers\nwith a < b ;\n(ii) τ 2 consists of R, Ø, and every interval (−r, r), for r any positive real number;\n(iii) τ 3 consists of R, Ø, and every interval (−r, r), for r any positive rational\nnumber;\n(iv) τ 4 consists of R, Ø, and every interval [−r, r], for r any positive rational\nnumber;\n(v) τ 5 consists of R, Ø, and every interval (−r, r), for r any positive irrational\nnumber;\n(vi) τ 6 consists of R, Ø, and every interval [−r, r], for r any positive irrational\nnumber;\n(vii) τ 7 consists of R, Ø, and every interval [−r, r), for r any positive real number;\n(viii) τ 8 consists of R, Ø, and every interval (−r, r], for r any positive real number;\n(ix) τ 9 consists of R, Ø, every interval [−r, r], and every interval (−r, r), for r\nany positive real number;\n(x) τ 10 consists of R, Ø, every interval [−n, n], and every interval (−r, r), for n\nany positive integer and r any positive real number.\n1.2\nOpen Sets, Closed Sets, and Clopen Sets\nRather than continually refer to “members of τ \", we find it more convenient to give\nsuch sets a name. We call them “open sets”. We shall also name the complements\nof open sets. They will be called “closed sets”. This nomenclature is not ideal, but\nderives from the so-called “open intervals” and “closed intervals” on the real number\nline. We shall have more to say about this in Chapter 2.\n1.2.1\nDefinition.\nLet (X,τ) be any topological space. Then the members\nof τ are said to be open sets.\n34\nCHAPTER 1.\nTOPOLOGICAL SPACES\n1.2.3\nExample.\nLet N be the set of all positive integers and let τ consist of\nØ and each subset S of N such that the complement of S in N, N\\S, is a finite set.\nIt is easily verified that τ satisfies Definitions 1.1.1 and so is a topology on N. (In\nthe next section we shall discuss this topology further. It is called the finite-closed\ntopology.) For each natural number n, define the set Sn as follows:\nSn = {1} ∪{n + 1} ∪{n + 2} ∪{n + 3} ∪· · · = {1} ∪\n∞\n[\nm=n+1\n{m}.\nClearly each Sn is an open set in the topology τ , since its complement is a finite\nset. However,\n∞\n\\\nn=1\nSn = {1}.\n(1)\nAs the complement of {1} is neither N nor a finite set, {1} is not open.\nSo (1)\nshows that the intersection of the open sets Sn is not open.\nYou might well ask: how did you find the example presented in Example 1.2.3?\nThe answer is unglamorous! It was by trial and error.\nIf we tried, for example, a discrete topology, we would find that each intersection\nof open sets is indeed open. The same is true of the indiscrete topology. So what\nyou need to do is some intelligent guesswork.\nRemember that to prove that the intersection of open sets is not necessarily\nopen, you need to find just one counterexample!\n1.2.4\nDefinition.\nLet (X,τ) be a topological space. A subset S of X is\nsaid to be a closed set in (X,τ) if its complement in X, namely X \\S, is open\nin (X,τ).\nIn Example 1.1.2, the closed sets are\nØ, X, {b, c, d, e, f}, {a, b, e, f}, {b, e, f} and {a}.\nIf (X,τ) is a discrete space, then it is obvious that every subset of X is a closed\nset. However in an indiscrete space, (X,τ), the only closed sets are X and Ø.\n36\nCHAPTER 1.\nTOPOLOGICAL SPACES\nWarning.\nThe names “open” and “closed” often lead newcomers to the world\nof topology into error.\nDespite the names, some open sets are also closed sets!\nMoreover, some sets are neither open sets nor closed sets! Indeed, if we consider\nExample 1.1.2 we see that\n(i) the set {a} is both open and closed;\n(ii) the set {b, c} is neither open nor closed;\n(iii) the set {c, d} is open but not closed;\n(iv) the set {a, b, e, f} is closed but not open.\nIn a discrete space every set is both open and closed, while in an indiscrete space\n(X,τ), all subsets of X except X and Ø are neither open nor closed.\nTo remind you that sets can be both open and closed we introduce the following\ndefinition.\n1.2.6\nDefinition.\nA subset S of a topological space (X,τ) is said to be\nclopen if it is both open and closed in (X,τ).\nIn every topological space (X,τ) both X and Ø are clopen1.\nIn a discrete space all subsets of X are clopen.\nIn an indiscrete space the only clopen subsets are X and Ø.\nExercises 1.2\n1.\nList all 64 subsets of the set X in Example 1.1.2. Write down, next to each set,\nwhether it is (i) clopen; (ii) neither open nor closed; (iii) open but not closed;\n(iv) closed but not open.\n2.\nLet (X,τ) be a topological space with the property that every subset is closed.\nProve that it is a discrete space.\n1We admit that “clopen” is an ugly word but its use is now widespread.\n38\nCHAPTER 1.\nTOPOLOGICAL SPACES\nDistinct Topologies on Finite and Infinite Sets\n7.\n(i) As recorded in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_topological_space,\nthe\nnumber of distinct topologies on a set with n ∈N points can be very large\neven for small n; namely when n = 2, there are 4 topologies; when n = 3,\nthere are 29 topologies: when n = 4, there are 355 topologies; when n = 5,\nthere are 6942 topologies etc. Using mathematical induction, prove that as\nn increases, the number of topologies increases.\n[Hint. It suffices to show that if a set with n points has M distinct topologies,\nthen a set with n + 1 points has at least M + 1 topologies.]\n(ii) Using mathematical induction prove that if the finite set X has n ∈N points,\nthen it has at least (n −1)! distinct topologies.\n[Hint.\nLet X = {x1, . . . , xn} and Y = {x1, . . . , xn, xn+1}.\nif τ is any\ntopology on X, fix an i ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}.\nDefine a topology τ i on Y\nas\nfollows: For each open set U ∈τ , define Ui by replacing any occurrence of\nxi in U by xn+1; then τ i consists of all such Ui plus the set Y . Verify that\nτ i is indeed a topology on Y . Deduce that for each topology on X, there\nare at least n distinct topologies on Y .]\n(iii) If X is any infinite set of cardinality ℵ, prove that there are at least 2ℵ\ndistinct topologies on X. Deduce that every infinite set has an uncountable\nnumber of distinct topologies on it.\n[Hint. Prove that there at least 2ℵdistinct topologies with precisely 3 open\nsets. For an introduction to cardinal numbers, see Appendix 1.]\n40\nCHAPTER 1.\nTOPOLOGICAL SPACES\n1.3.3\nExample.\nLet τ be the finite-closed topology on a set X. If X has at\nleast 3 distinct clopen subsets, prove that X is a finite set.\nProof.\nWe are given that τ is the finite-closed topology, and that there are at least\n3 distinct clopen subsets.\nWe are required to prove that X is a finite set.\nRecall that τ is the finite-closed topology means that the family of all\nclosed sets consists of X and all finite subsets of X. Recall also that a set\nis clopen if and only if it is both closed and open.\nRemember that in every topological space there are at least 2 clopen\nsets, namely X and Ø. (See the comment immediately following Definition\n1.2.6.) But we are told that in the space (X,τ) there are at least 3 clopen\nsubsets. This implies that there is a clopen subset other than Ø and X. So\nwe shall have a careful look at this other clopen set!\nAs our space (X,τ) has 3 distinct clopen subsets, we know that there is a clopen\nsubset S of X such that S ̸= X and S ̸= Ø. As S is open in (X,τ), Definition 1.2.4\nimplies that its complement X \\ S is a closed set.\nThus S and X \\ S are closed in the finite-closed topology τ . Therefore S and\nX \\ S are both finite, since neither equals X. But X = S ∪(X \\ S) and so X is the\nunion of two finite sets. Thus X is a finite set, as required.\nWe now know three distinct topologies we can put on any infinite set – and\nthere are many more. The three we know are the discrete topology, the indiscrete\ntopology, and the finite-closed topology. So we must be careful always to specify\nthe topology on a set.\nFor example, the set {n : n ⩾10} is open in the finite-closed topology on the\nset of natural numbers, but is not open in the indiscrete topology. The set of odd\nnatural numbers is open in the discrete topology on the set of natural numbers, but\nis not open in the finite-closed topology.\n42\nCHAPTER 1.\nTOPOLOGICAL SPACES\nWe now turn to a very important notion that you may not have met before.\n1.3.7\nDefinition.\nLet f be a function from a set X into a set Y . If S is\nany subset of Y , then the set f−1(S) is defined by\nf−1(S) = {x : x ∈X and f(x) ∈S}.\nThe subset f−1(S) of X is said to be the inverse image of S.\nNote that an inverse function of f : X →Y exists if and only if f is bijective.\nBut the inverse image of any subset of Y exists even if f is neither one-to-one nor\nonto. The next example demonstrates this.\n1.3.8\nExample.\nLet f be the function from the set of integers, Z, into itself\ngiven by f(z) = |z|, for each z ∈Z.\nThe function f is not one-to one, since f(1) = f(−1).\nIt is also not onto, since there is no z ∈Z, such that f(z) = −1.\nSo f is\ncertainly not bijective. Hence, by Proposition 1.3.6 (i), f does not have an inverse\nfunction. However inverse images certainly exist. For example,\nf−1({1, 2, 3}) = {−1, −2, −3, 1, 2, 3}\nf−1({−5, 3, 5, 7, 9}) = {−3, −5, −7, −9, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n□\nWe conclude this section with an interesting example.\n1.3.9\nExample.\nLet (Y,τ) be a topological space and X a non-empty set.\nFurther, let f be a function from X into Y . Put τ 1 = {f−1(S) : S ∈τ}. Prove\nthat τ 1 is a topology on X.\nProof.\nOur task is to show that the collection of sets, τ 1, is a topology on X;\nthat is, we have to show that τ 1 satisfies conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of\nDefinitions 1.1.1\n44\nCHAPTER 1.\nTOPOLOGICAL SPACES\nExercises 1.3\n1.

In Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_topological_space, as we noted\nin Exercises 1.2 #7, it says that the number of topologies on a finite set with\nn ∈N points can be quite large, even for small n.\nThis is also true even for\nT0-spaces as defined in Exercises 1.3 #5. Indeed that same Wikipedia source\nsays, that if n = 3, there are 19 distinct T0-spaces; for n = 4, there are 219\ndistinct T0-spaces; for n = 5, there are 4231 distinct T0-spaces. Prove, using\nmathematical induction, that as n increases, the number of T0-spaces increases.\n[Hint.\nIt suffices to show that if there are M T0-spaces with n points, then\nthere are at least M + 1 T0-spaces with n + 1 points.]\n48\nCHAPTER 1.\nTOPOLOGICAL SPACES\nEn route we met the terms “open set” and “closed set” and we were warned\nthat these names can be misleading.\nSets can be both open and closed, neither\nopen nor closed, open but not closed, or closed but not open. It is important to\nremember that we cannot prove that a set is open by proving that it is not closed.\nOther than the definitions of topology, topological space, open set, and closed\nset the most significant topic covered was that of writing proofs .\nIn the opening comments of this chapter we pointed out the importance of\nlearning to write proofs.\nIn Example 1.1.8, Proposition 1.1.9, and Example 1.3.3\nwe have seen how to “think through” a proof. It is essential that you develop your\nown skill at writing proofs. Good exercises to try for this purpose include Exercises\n1.1 #8, Exercises 1.2 #2,4, and Exercises 1.3 #1,4.\nIf you have not already done so, you should watch the\nfirst two of the YouTube videos on proofs.\nThey are\ncalled\n“Topology Without Tears – Video 4a – Writing Proofs\nin Mathematics” and “Topology Without Tears – Video\n4b – Writing Proofs in Mathematics”\nand can be found at\nhttp://youtu.be/T1snRQEQuEk and http://youtu.be/VrAwuszhzTw\nor on the Chinese Youku site at\nhttp://tinyurl.com/mwpmlqs and http://tinyurl.com/n3jjmsm\nor by following the relevant link from\nhttp://www.topologywithouttears.net.\nIt would also be quite helpful to watch the fourth video\non writing proofs.\nIt is on writing proofs which use\nMathematical Induction.

We call them “open sets”. We shall also name the complements\nof open sets. They will be called “closed sets”. This nomenclature is not ideal, but\nderives from the so-called “open intervals” and “closed intervals” on the real number\nline. We shall have more to say about this in Chapter 2.\n1.2.1\nDefinition.\nLet (X,τ) be any topological space. Then the members\nof τ are said to be open sets.\nChapter 2\nThe Euclidean Topology\nIntroduction\nIn a movie or a novel there are usually a few central characters about whom the\nplot revolves.\nIn the story of topology, the euclidean topology on the set of real\nnumbers is one of the central characters. Indeed it is such a rich example that we\nshall frequently return to it for inspiration and further examination.\nLet R denote the set of all real numbers.\nIn Chapter 1 we defined three\ntopologies that can be put on any set: the discrete topology, the indiscrete topology\nand the finite-closed topology. So we know three topologies that can be put on the\nset R. Six other topologies on R were defined in Exercises 1.1 #5 and #9. In this\nchapter we describe a much more important and interesting topology on R which is\nknown as the euclidean topology.\nAn analysis of the euclidean topology leads us to the notion of “basis for a\ntopology”.\nIn the study of Linear Algebra we learn that every vector space has a\nbasis and every vector is a linear combination of members of the basis. Similarly, in\na topological space every open set can be expressed as a union of members of the\nbasis. Indeed, a set is open if and only if it is a union of members of the basis.\nIn order to understand this chapter, you should familiarize yourself with the\ncontent of the first section of Appendix 1; that is A1.1.

We want to find a and b in R with\na < b such that x ∈(a, b) ⊆(r, s).\nLet x ∈(r, s). Choose a = r and b = s. Then clearly\nx ∈(a, b) ⊆(r, s).\nSo (r, s) is an open set in the euclidean topology.\n□\n(iii)\nThe open intervals (r, ∞) and (−∞, r) are open sets in R, for every real\nnumber r.\nProof.\nFirstly, we shall show that (r, ∞) is an open set; that is, that it has property\n(∗).\nTo show this we let x ∈(r, ∞) and seek a, b ∈R such that\nx ∈(a, b) ⊆(r, ∞).\nLet x ∈(r, ∞).\nPut a = r and b = x + 1.\nThen x ∈(a, b) ⊆(r, ∞) and so\n(r, ∞) ∈τ.\nA similar argument shows that (−∞, r) is an open set in R.\n□\n54\nCHAPTER 2.\nTHE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY\n(vii)\nEach singleton set {a} is closed in R.\nProof.\nThe complement of {a} is the union of the two open sets (−∞, a) and\n(a, ∞) and so is open. Therefore {a} is closed in R, as required.\n[In the terminology of Exercises 1.3 #3, this result says that R is a T1-space.]□\n(viii)\nNote that we could have included (vii) in (vi) simply by replacing “a < b”\nby “a ⩽b”. The singleton set {a} is just the degenerate case of the closed interval\n[a, b].\n□\n(ix)\nThe set Z of all integers is a closed subset of R.\nProof.\nThe complement of Z is the union S∞\nn=−∞(n, n + 1) of open subsets\n(n, n + 1) of R and so is open in R. Therefore Z is closed in R.\n□\n(x)\nThe set Q of all rational numbers is neither a closed subset of R nor an\nopen subset of R.\nProof.\nWe shall show that Q is not an open set by proving that it does not have\nproperty (∗).\nTo do this it suffices to show that Q does not contain any interval (a, b),\nwith a < b.\nSuppose that (a, b) ⊆Q, where a and b are in R with a < b. Between any two\ndistinct real numbers there is an irrational number. (Can you prove this?) Therefore\nthere exists c ∈(a, b) such that c /∈Q. This contradicts (a, b) ⊆Q. Hence Q does\nnot contain any interval (a, b), and so is not an open set.\nTo prove that Q is not a closed set it suffices to show that R\\Q is not an open\nset. Using the fact that between any two distinct real numbers there is a rational\nnumber we see that R \\ Q does not contain any interval (a, b) with a < b. So R \\ Q\nis not open in R and hence Q is not closed in R.\n□\n(xi)\nIn Chapter 3 we shall prove that the only clopen subsets of R are the\ntrivial ones, namely R and Ø.\n□\n56\nCHAPTER 2.\nTHE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY\n2.2\nBasis for a Topology\nRemarks 2.1.2 allow us to describe the euclidean topology on R in a much more\nconvenient manner. To do this, we introduce the notion of a basis for a topology.\n2.2.1\nProposition.\nA subset S of R is open if and only if it is a union of\nopen intervals.\nProof.\nWe are required to prove that S is open if and only if it is a union of open\nintervals; that is, we have to show that\n(i) if S is a union of open intervals, then it is an open set, and\n(ii) if S is an open set, then it is a union of open intervals.\nAssume that S is a union of open intervals; that is, there exist open intervals\n(aj, bj), where j belongs to some index set J, such that S = S\nj∈J(aj, bj).\nBy\nRemarks 2.1.2 (ii) each open interval (aj, bj) is an open set. Thus S is a union of\nopen sets and so S is an open set.\nConversely, assume that S is open in R. Then for each x ∈S, there exists an\ninterval Ix = (a, b) such that x ∈Ix ⊆S. We now claim that S = S\nx∈S Ix.\nWe are required to show that the two sets S and S\nx∈S Ix are equal.\nThese sets are shown to be equal by proving that\n(i) if y ∈S, then y ∈S\nx∈S Ix, and\n(ii) if z ∈S\nx∈S Ix, then z ∈S.\n[Note that (i) is equivalent to the statement S ⊆S\nx∈S Ix, while (ii) is\nequivalent to S\nx∈S Ix ⊆S.]\nFirstly let y ∈S. Then y ∈Iy. So y ∈S\nx∈S Ix, as required.\nSecondly, let\nz ∈S\nx∈S Ix. Then z ∈It, for some t ∈S. As each Ix ⊆S, we see that It ⊆S and\nso z ∈S. Hence S = S\nx∈S Ix, and we have that S is a union of open intervals, as\nrequired.\n58\nCHAPTER 2.\nTHE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY\n2.2.6\nRemark.\nObserve that if (X,τ) is a topological space then B = τ is a\nbasis for the topology τ . So, for example, the set of all subsets of X is a basis for\nthe discrete topology on X.\nWe see, therefore, that there can be many different bases for the same topology.\nIndeed if B is a basis for a topology τ on a set X and B1 is a collection of subsets\nof X such that B ⊆B1 ⊆τ , then B1 is also a basis for τ . [Verify this.]\n□\nAs indicated above the notion of “basis for a topology” allows us to define\ntopologies. However the following example shows that we must be careful.\n2.2.7\nExample.\nLet X = {a, b, c} and B = {{a}, {c}, {a, b}, {b, c}}. Then B is\nnot a basis for any topology on X. To see this, suppose that B is a basis for a\ntopology τ . Then τ consists of all unions of sets in B; that is,\nτ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c}, {a, c}, {a, b}, {b, c}}.\n(Once again we use the fact that Ø is an empty union of members of B and so\nØ ∈τ .)\nHowever, τ is not a topology since the set {b} = {a, b} ∩{b, c} is not in τ and\nso τ does not have property (iii) of Definitions 1.1.1. This is a contradiction, and\nso our supposition is false. Thus B is not a basis for any topology on X.\n□\nThus we are led to ask: if B is a collection of subsets of X, under what conditions\nis B a basis for a topology? This question is answered by Proposition 2.2.8.\n60\nCHAPTER 2.\nTHE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY\nProposition 2.2.8 is a very useful result.\nIt allows us to define topologies by\nsimply writing down a basis. This is often easier than trying to describe all of the\nopen sets.\nWe shall now use this Proposition to define a topology on the plane.\nThis\ntopology is known as the “euclidean topology”.\n2.2.9\nExample.\nLet B be the collection of all “open rectangles”\n{⟨x, y⟩: ⟨x, y⟩∈R2, a < x < b, c < y < d} in the plane which have each side\nparallel to the X- or Y -axis.\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\n.................\na\nb\nc\nd\nX\nY\n.............................................\n........................\n.........................................\n........................\nThen B is a basis for a topology on the plane. This topology is called the euclidean\ntopology.\nWhenever we use the symbol R2 we mean the plane, and if we refer to R2 as a\ntopological space without explicitly saying what the topology is, we mean the plane\nwith the euclidean topology.\nTo see that B is indeed a basis for a topology, observe that (i) the plane is the\nunion of all of the open rectangles, and (ii) the intersection of any two rectangles is\na rectangle. [By “rectangle” we mean one with sides parallel to the axes.] So the\nconditions of Proposition 2.2.8 are satisfied and hence B is a basis for a topology.□\n2.2.10\nRemark.\nBy generalizing Example 2.2.9 we see how to put a topology\non\nRn = {⟨x1, x2, . . . , xn⟩: xi ∈R, i = 1, . . . , n}, for each integer n > 2. We\nlet B be the collection of all subsets {⟨x1, x2, . . . , xn⟩∈Rn : ai < xi < bi, i =\n1, 2, . . . , n} of Rn with sides parallel to the axes. This collection B is a basis for\nthe euclidean topology on Rn.\n□\n62\nCHAPTER 2.\nTHE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY\n[Hint: do not use Proposition 2.2.8 as this would show only that B is a basis for\nsome topology not necessarily a basis for the euclidean topology.]\nSecond Axiom of Countability\n4. A topological space (X,τ) is said to satisfy the second axiom of countability\nor to be second countable if there exists a basis B for τ , where B consists of\nonly a countable number of sets.\n(i) Using Exercise 3 above show that R satisfies the second axiom of countability.\n(ii) Prove that the discrete topology on an uncountable set does not satisfy the\nsecond axiom of countability.\n[Hint: It is not enough to show that one particular basis is uncountable. You\nmust prove that every basis for this topology is uncountable.]\n(iii) Prove that Rn satisfies the second axiom of countability, for each positive\ninteger n.\n(iv) Let (X,τ) be the set of all integers with the finite-closed topology. Does\nthe space (X,τ) satisfy the second axiom of countability?\n5. Prove the following statements.\n(i) Let m and c be real numbers. Then the line L = {⟨x, y⟩: y = mx + c} is a\nclosed subset of R2.\n(ii) Let S1 be the unit circle given by S1 = {⟨x, y⟩∈R2 : x2 + y2 = 1}. Then\nS1 is a closed subset of R2.\n(iii) Let Sn be the unit n-sphere given by\nSn = {⟨x1, x2, . . . , xn, xn+1⟩∈Rn+1 : x2\n1 + x2\n2 + · · · + x2\nn+1 = 1}.\nThen Sn is a closed subset of Rn+1.\n(iv) Let Bn be the closed unit n-ball given by\nBn = {⟨x1, x2, . . . , xn⟩∈Rn : x2\n1 + x2\n2 + · · · + x2n ⩽1}.\nThen Bn is a closed subset of Rn.\n(v) The curve C = {⟨x, y⟩∈R2 : xy = 1} is a closed subset of R2.\n64\nCHAPTER 2.\nTHE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY\n2.3.2\nProposition.\nLet (X,τ) be a topological space. A family B of open\nsubsets of X is a basis for τ if and only if for any point x belonging to any open\nset U, there is a B ∈B such that x ∈B ⊆U.\nProof.\nWe are required to prove that\n(i) if B is a basis for τ and x ∈U ∈τ , then there exists a B ∈B such that\nx ∈B ⊆U,\nand\n(ii) if for each U ∈τ and x ∈U there exists a B ∈B such that x ∈B ⊆U,\nthen B is a basis for τ .\nAssume B is a basis for τ and x ∈U ∈τ . As B is a basis for τ , the open set\nU is a union of members of B; that is, U = S\nj∈J Bj, where Bj ∈B, for each j in\nsome index set J. But x ∈U implies x ∈Bj, for some j ∈J. Thus x ∈Bj ⊆U,\nas required.\nConversely, assume that for each U ∈τ and each x ∈U, there exists a B ∈B\nwith x ∈B ⊆U. We have to show that every open set is a union of members of\nB. So let V be any open set. Then for each x ∈V , there is a Bx ∈B such that\nx ∈Bx ⊆V . Clearly V = S\nx∈V Bx. (Check this!) Thus V is a union of members\nof B.\n□\n2.3.3\nProposition.\nLet B be a basis for a topology τ on a set X. Then\na subset U of X is open if and only if for each x ∈U there exists a B ∈B such\nthat x ∈B ⊆U.\nProof.\nLet U be any subset of X. Assume that for each x ∈U, there exists a\nBx ∈B such that x ∈Bx ⊆U. Clearly U = S\nx∈U Bx. So U is a union of open sets\nand hence is open, as required. The converse statement follows from Proposition\n2.3.2.\n□\n66\nCHAPTER 2.\nTHE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY\n2.3.5\nExample.\nShow that the set B of all “open equilateral triangles” with\nbase parallel to the X-axis is a basis for the euclidean topology on R2. (By an “open\ntriangle” we mean that the boundary is not included.)\nOutline Proof.\n(We give here only a pictorial argument. It is left to you to write\na detailed proof.)\nWe are required to show that B is a basis for the euclidean topology.\nWe shall apply Proposition 2.3.4, but first we need to show that B is a\nbasis for some topology on R2.\nTo do this we show that B satisfies the conditions of Proposition 2.2.8.\n................................................................................................................................................................................\n.......\n....\n....\n......\n......\n........\n........\n.........\n..........\n...........\n...........\n.............\n.............\n..............\n...............\n................\n.................\n..................\n..................\n....................\n....................\n....................\n..................\n..................\n.................\n................\n...............\n..............\n.............\n.............\n...........\n...........\n..........\n.........\n........\n.......\n......\n......\n....\n....\n...\n....\nX\nY\n...........................................\n...........................\n...........................................\n...........................\nThe first thing we observe is that B is a basis for some topology because it\nsatisfies the conditions of Proposition 2.2.8.\n(To see that B satisfies Proposition\n2.2.8, observe that R2 equals the union of all open equilateral triangles with base\nparallel to the X-axis, and that the intersection of two such triangles is another such\ntriangle.)\nNext we shall show that the conditions (i) and (ii) of Proposition 2.3.4 are\nsatisfied.\nFirstly we verify condition (i). Let R be an open rectangle with sides parallel to\nthe axes and any x any point in R. We have to show that there is an open equilateral\ntriangle T with base parallel to the X-axis such that x ∈T ⊆R. Pictorially this is\neasy to see.\n68\nCHAPTER 2.\nTHE EUCLIDEAN TOPOLOGY\nExercises 2.3\n1.\nDetermine whether or not each of the following collections is a basis for the\neuclidean topology on R2 :\n(i) the collection of all “open” squares with sides parallel to the axes;\n(ii) the collection of all “open” discs;\n(iii) the collection of all “open” squares;\n(iv) the collection of all “open” rectangles;\n(v) the collection of all “open” triangles.\n2.\n(i) Let B be a basis for a topology τ on a non-empty set X.

However, not all open sets are open intervals. Nevertheless,\nevery open set in R is a union of open intervals. This led us to introduce the notion\nof “basis for a topology” and to establish that the collection of all open intervals is\na basis for the euclidean topology on R.\nIn the introduction to Chapter 1 we described a mathematical proof as a\nwatertight argument and underlined the importance of writing proofs. In this chapter\nwe were introduced to proof by contradiction in Remarks 2.1.2 (v) with another\nexample in Example 2.2.7. Proving “necessary and sufficient” conditions, that is, “if\nand only if” conditions, was explained in Proposition 2.2.1, with further examples in\nPropositions 2.2.8, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, and 2.3.4.\nBases for topologies is a significant topic in its own right. We saw, for example,\nthat the collection of all singletons is a basis for the discrete topology. Proposition\n2.2.8 gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a collection of subsets of a set X\nto be a basis for some topology on X. This was contrasted with Proposition 2.3.2\nwhich gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a collection of subsets of X to\nbe a basis for the given topology on X. It was noted that two different collections\nB1 and B2 can be bases for the same topology. Necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor this are given by Proposition 2.3.4.\nWe defined the euclidean topology on Rn, for n any positive integer. We saw\nthat the family of all open discs is a basis for R2, as is the family of all open squares,\nor the family of all open rectangles.\nThe exercises introduced three interesting ideas. Exercises 2.1 #8 covered the\nnotions of Fσ-set and Gδ-set which are important in measure theory.\nExercises\n2.3 #4 introduced the space of continuous real-valued functions. Such spaces are\ncalled function spaces which are the central objects of study in functional analysis.\nFunctional analysis is a blend of (classical) analysis and topology, and was for some\ntime called modern analysis, cf. Simmons [364]. Finally, Exercises 2.3 #5–12 dealt\nwith the notion of subbasis.\n"

Therefore {a} is closed in R, as required.\n[In the terminology of Exercises 1.3 #3, this result says that R is a T1-space.]□\n(viii)\nNote that we could have included (vii) in (vi) simply by replacing “a < b”\nby “a ⩽b”. The singleton set {a} is just the degenerate case of the closed interval\n[a, b].\n□\n(ix)\nThe set Z of all integers is a closed subset of R.\nProof.\nThe complement of Z is the union S∞\nn=−∞(n, n + 1) of open subsets\n(n, n + 1) of R and so is open in R. Therefore Z is closed in R.\n□\n(x)\nThe set Q of all rational numbers is neither a closed subset of R nor an\nopen subset of R.\nProof.\nWe shall show that Q is not an open set by proving that it does not have\nproperty (∗).\nTo do this it suffices to show that Q does not contain any interval (a, b),\nwith a < b.\nSuppose that (a, b) ⊆Q, where a and b are in R with a < b. Between any two\ndistinct real numbers there is an irrational number. (Can you prove this?) Therefore\nthere exists c ∈(a, b) such that c /∈Q. This contradicts (a, b) ⊆Q. Hence Q does\nnot contain any interval (a, b), and so is not an open set.\nTo prove that Q is not a closed set it suffices to show that R\\Q is not an open\nset. Using the fact that between any two distinct real numbers there is a rational\nnumber we see that R \\ Q does not contain any interval (a, b) with a < b. So R \\ Q\nis not open in R and hence Q is not closed in R.\n□\n(xi)\nIn Chapter 3 we shall prove that the only clopen subsets of R are the\ntrivial ones, namely R and Ø.\n□\nChapter 3\nLimit Points\nIntroduction\nOn the real number line we have a notion of “closeness”. For example each point\nin the sequence .1, .01, .001, .0001, .00001, . . . is closer to 0 than the previous one.\nIndeed, in some sense, 0 is a limit point of this sequence. So the interval (0, 1] is not\nclosed, as it does not contain the limit point 0. In a general topological space we do\nnot have a “distance function”, so we must proceed differently. We shall define the\nnotion of limit point without resorting to distances. Even with our new definition\nof limit point, the point 0 will still be a limit point of (0, 1] . The introduction of\nthe notion of limit point will lead us to a much better understanding of the notion\nof closed set.\nAnother very important topological concept we shall introduce in this chapter is\nthat of connectedness. Consider the topological space R. While the sets [0, 1]∪[2, 3]\nand [4, 6] could both be described as having length 2, it is clear that they are different\ntypes of sets . . . the first consists of two disjoint pieces and the second of just one\npiece. The difference between the two is “topological” and will be exposed using\nthe notion of connectedness.\n72\n"

Suppose that p is a limit point of A which\nbelongs to X \\ A.\nThen X \\ A is an open set containing the limit point p of A.\nTherefore X \\ A contains an element of A. This is clearly false and so we have a\ncontradiction to our supposition. Therefore every limit point of A must belong to\nA.\nConversely, assume that A contains all of its limit points. For each z ∈X \\ A,\nour assumption implies that there exists an open set Uz ∋z such that Uz ∩A = Ø;\nthat is, Uz ⊆X \\ A. Therefore X \\ A = S\nz∈X\\A Uz. (Check this!)

If this is not the case, then proceed directly to Definition\n5.1.3.

Even [1, 2] is not open in R,\nbut is an open set in [1, 2].\nSo whenever we speak of a set being open we must make perfectly clear in what\nspace or what topology it is an open set.\n□\n4.1.6\nExample.\nLet Z be the subset of R consisting of all the integers. Prove\nthat the topology induced on Z by the euclidean topology on R is the discrete\ntopology.\nProof.\nTo prove that the induced topology, τ Z, on Z is discrete, it suffices, by\nProposition 1.1.9, to show that every singleton set in Z is open in τ Z; that\nis, if n ∈Z then {n} ∈τ Z.\nLet n ∈Z. Then {n} = (n −1, n + 1) ∩Z. But (n −1, n + 1) is open in R and\ntherefore {n} is open in the induced topology on Z. Thus every singleton set in Z\nis open in the induced topology on Z.

We begin by considering\nan example:\nX = {a, b, c, d, e},\nY = {g, h, i, j, k},\nτ = {X, Ø, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e}},\nand\nτ 1 = {Y, Ø, {g}, {i, j}, {g, i, j}, {h, i, j, k}}.\nIt is clear that in an intuitive sense (X,τ) is “equivalent” to (Y,τ 1). The function\nf : X →Y\ndefined by f(a) = g, f(b) = h, f(c) = i, f(d) = j, and f(e) = k,\nprovides the equivalence. We now formalize this.\n4.2.1\nDefinition.\nLet (X,τ) and (Y,τ 1) be topological spaces.\nThen\nthey are said to be homeomorphic if there exists a function f : X →Y which\nhas the following properties:\n(i) f is one-to-one (that is f(x1) = f(x2) implies x1 = x2),\n(ii) f is onto (that is, for any y ∈Y there exists an x ∈X such that f(x) = y),\n(iii) for each U ∈τ 1, f−1(U) ∈τ, and\n(iv) for each V ∈τ, f(V ) ∈τ 1.\nFurther, the map f is said to be a homeomorphism between (X,τ) and (Y,τ 1).\nWe write (X,τ) ∼= (Y,τ 1).\n□\nWe shall show that “∼=” is an equivalence relation and use this to show that\nall open intervals (a, b) are homeomorphic to each other. Example 4.2.2 is the first\nstep, as it shows that “∼=” is a transitive relation.\n98\nCHAPTER 4.\nHOMEOMORPHISMS\n4.2.4\nExample.\nProve that every two non-empty open intervals (a, b) and (c, d)\nare homeomorphic.\nOutline Proof.\nBy Remark 4.2.3 it suffices to show that (a, b) is homeomorphic to (0, 1) and\n(c, d) is homeomorphic to (0, 1). But as a and b are arbitrary (except that\na < b), if (a, b) is homeomorphic to (0, 1) then (c, d) is also homeomorphic\nto (0, 1). To prove that (a, b) is homeomorphic to (0, 1) it suffices to find a\nhomeomorphism f : (0, 1) →(a, b).\nLet a, b ∈R with a < b and consider the function f : (0, 1) →(a, b) given by\nf(x) = a(1 −x) + bx.\n.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\na\nb\n0\n1\nClearly f : (0, 1) →(a, b) is one-to-one and onto. It is also clear from the diagram\nthat the image under f of any open interval in (0, 1) is an open interval in (a, b);\nthat is,\nf(open interval in (0, 1)) = an open interval in (a, b).\nBut every open set in (0, 1) is a union of open intervals in (0, 1) and so\nf(open set in (0, 1)) = f(union of open intervals in (0, 1))\n=\nunion of open intervals in (a, b)\n=\nopen set in (a, b).\nSo condition (iv) of Definition 4.2.1 is satisfied. Similarly, we see that f−1 (open\nset in (a, b)) is an open set in (0, 1).\nSo condition (iii) of Definition 4.2.1 is also\nsatisfied.\n[Exercise:\nwrite out the above proof carefully.]\n100\nCHAPTER 4.\nHOMEOMORPHISMS\nExercises 4.2\n1.\n(i) If a, b, c, and d are real numbers with a < b and c < d, prove that [a, b] ∼= [c, d].\n(ii) If a and b are any real numbers, prove that\n(−∞, a] ∼= (−∞, b] ∼= [a, ∞) ∼= [b, ∞).\n(iii) If c, d, e, and f are any real numbers with c < d and e < f, prove that\n[c, d) ∼= [e, f) ∼= (c, d] ∼= (e, f].\n(iv) Deduce that for any real numbers a and b with a < b,\n[0, 1) ∼= (−∞, a] ∼= [a, ∞) ∼= [a, b) ∼= (a, b].\n2.\nProve that Z ∼= N\n3.\nLet m and c be real numbers and X the subspace of R2 given by X = {⟨x, y⟩:\ny = mx + c}. Prove that X is homeomorphic to R.\n4.\n(i) Let X1 and X2 be the closed rectangular regions in R2 given by\nX1 = {⟨x, y⟩: |x| ⩽a1 and |y| ⩽b1}\nand\nX2 = {⟨x, y⟩: |x| ⩽a2 and |y| ⩽b2}\nwhere a1, b1, a2, and b2 are positive real numbers. If X1 and X2 are given their\ninduced topologies, τ 1 and τ 2 respectively, from R2, show that X1 ∼= X2.\n(ii) Let D1 and D2 be the closed discs in R2 given by\nD1 = {⟨x, y⟩: x2 + y2 ⩽c1}\nand\nD2 = {⟨x, y⟩: x2 + y2 ⩽c2}\nwhere c1 and c2 are positive real numbers. Prove that the topological space\nD1 ∼= D2, where D1 and D2 have their subspace topologies.\n(iii) Prove that X1 ∼= D1.\n102\nCHAPTER 4.\nHOMEOMORPHISMS\n4.3.1\nExample.\nProve that [0, 2] is not homeomorphic to the subspace\n[0, 1] ∪[2, 3] of R.\nProof.\nLet (X,τ) = [0, 2] and (Y,τ 1) = [0, 1] ∪[2, 3]. Then\n[0, 1] = [0, 1] ∩Y ⇒[0, 1] is closed in (Y,τ 1)\nand\n[0, 1] = (−1, 1\n1\n2) ∩Y ⇒[0, 1] is open in (Y,τ 1).\nThus Y is not connected, as it has [0, 1] as a proper non-empty clopen subset.\nSuppose that (X,τ) ∼= (Y,τ 1). Then there exists a homeomorphism f : (X,τ) →\n(Y,τ 1). So f−1([0, 1]) is a proper non-empty clopen subset of X, and hence X is\nnot connected. This is false as [0, 2] = X is connected. (See Exercises 4.1 #15.)\nSo we have a contradiction and thus (X,τ) ̸∼= (Y,τ 1).\n□\nWhat do we learn from this?\n4.3.2\nProposition.\nAny topological space homeomorphic to a connected\nspace is connected.\n□\nProposition 4.3.2 gives us one way to try to show two topological spaces are\nnot homeomorphic . . . by finding a property “preserved by homeomorphisms” which\none space has and the other does not.\n104\nCHAPTER 4.\nHOMEOMORPHISMS\nBefore moving on to this let us settle the following question: which subspaces\nof R are connected?\n4.3.3\nDefinition.\nA subset S of R is said to be an interval if it has the\nfollowing property: if x ∈S, z ∈S, and y ∈R are such that x < y < z, then\ny ∈S.\n4.3.4\nRemarks.\nNote the following:\n(i) Each singleton set {x} is an interval.\n(ii) Every interval has one of the following forms: {a}, [a, b], (a, b), [a, b), (a, b],\n(−∞, a), (−∞, a], (a, ∞), [a, ∞), (−∞, ∞).\n(iii) It follows from Example 4.2.6, Remark 4.2.7, and Exercises 4.2 #1, that every\ninterval is homeomorphic to (0, 1), [0, 1], [0, 1), or {0}. In Exercises 4.3 #1 we\nare able to make an even stronger statement.\n4.3.5\nProposition.\nA subspace S of R is connected if and only if it is an\ninterval.\nProof.\nThat all intervals are connected can be proved in a similar fashion to\nProposition 3.3.3 by replacing R everywhere in the proof by the interval we are\ntrying to prove connected.\nConversely, let S be connected.\nSuppose x ∈S, z ∈S, x < y < z, and y /∈S.\nThen (−∞, y) ∩S = (−∞, y] ∩S is an open and closed subset of S.\nSo S has\na clopen subset, namely (−∞, y) ∩S. To show that S is not connected we have\nto verify only that this clopen set is proper and non-empty. It is non-empty as it\ncontains x. It is proper as z ∈S but z /∈(−∞, y) ∩S. So S is not connected. This\nis a contradiction. Therefore S is an interval.\n□\nWe now see a reason for the name “connected”. Subspaces of R such as [a, b],\n(a, b), etc. are connected, while subspaces like X = [0, 1] ∪[2, 3] ∪[5, 6], which is a\nunion of “disconnected” pieces, are not connected.\nNow let us turn to the problem of showing that (0, 1) ̸∼= [0, 1]. Firstly, we present\na seemingly trivial observation.\n106\nCHAPTER 4.\nHOMEOMORPHISMS\nExercises 4.3\n1. Deduce from the above that every interval is homeomorphic to one and only\none of the following spaces:\n{0};\n(0, 1);\n[0, 1];\n[0, 1).\n2. Deduce from Proposition 4.3.5 that every countable subspace of R with more\nthan one point is disconnected. (In particular, Z and Q are disconnected.)\n3. Let X be the unit circle in R2; that is, X = {⟨x, y⟩: x2 + y2 = 1} and has the\nsubspace topology.\n(i) Show that X \\ {⟨1, 0⟩} is homeomorphic to the open interval (0, 1).\n(ii) Deduce that X ̸∼= (0, 1) and X ̸∼= [0, 1].\n(iii) Observing that for every point a ∈X, the subspace X \\ {a} is connected,\nshow that X ̸∼= [0, 1).\n(iv) Deduce that X is not homeomorphic to any interval.\n4. Let Y be the subspace of R2 given by\nY = {⟨x, y⟩: x2 + y2 = 1} ∪{⟨x, y⟩: (x −2)2 + y2 = 1}\n(i) Is Y homeomorphic to the space X in Exercise 3 above?\n(ii) Is Y homeomorphic to an interval?\n5. Let Z be the subspace of R2 given by\nZ = {⟨x, y⟩: x2 + y2 = 1} ∪{⟨x, y⟩: (x −3/2)2 + y2 = 1}.\nShow that\n(i) Z is not homeomorphic to any interval, and\n(ii) Z is not homeomorphic to X or Y , the spaces described in Exercises 3 and\nExercise 4 above.\n6. Prove that the Sorgenfrey line is not homeomorphic to R, R2, or any subspace\nof either of these spaces.\n108\nCHAPTER 4.\nHOMEOMORPHISMS\nLocal Homeomorphism\n9. Let (X,τ) and (Y,τ 1) be topological spaces. A map f : X →Y is said to be a\nlocal homeomorphism if each point x ∈X has an open neighbourhood U such\nthat the restriction of f to U maps U homeomorphically onto an open subspace\nV of (Y,τ 1); that is, if the topology induced on U by τ is τ 2 and the topology\ninduced on V = f(U) by τ 1 is τ 3, then f is a homeomorphism of (U,τ 2) onto\n(V,τ 3). The topological space (X,τ) is said to be locally homeomorphic to\n(Y,τ 1) if there exists a local homeomorphism of (X,τ) into (Y,τ 1).\n(i)\nIf (X,τ) and (Y,τ 1) are homeomorphic topological spaces, verify that\n(X,τ) is locally homeomorphic to (Y,τ 1).\n(ii)\nIf (X,τ) is an open subspace of (Y,τ 1), prove that (X,τ) is locally\nhomeomorphic to (Y,τ 1).\n(iii)* Prove that if f : (X,τ) →(Y,τ 1) is a local homeomorphism, then f maps\nevery open subset of (X,τ) onto an open subset of (Y,τ 1).\n10. A subset A of a topological space (X,τ) is said to be semi-open if there exists\nan open set O ∈(X,τ) such that O ⊆A ⊆O. Verify the following:\n(i) every open set is a semi-open set;\n(ii) a closed set is not necessarily a semi-open set;\n(iii) if A is an interval other than a singleton set in R, then A is a semi-open\nsubset of R;\n(iv) if τ is the finite-closed topology, the discrete topology or the indiscrete\ntopology then the semi-open sets are precisely the open sets.\n"

Metric\nspaces provide a rich source of examples in topology. But more than this, most of\nthe applications of topology to analysis are via metric spaces.\nThe notion of metric space was introduced in 1906 by Maurice Fréchet and\ndeveloped and named by Felix Hausdorff in 1914 (Hausdorff [173]).\n6.1\nMetric Spaces\n6.1.1\nDefinition.\nLet X be a non-empty set and d a real-valued function\ndefined on X × X such that for a, b ∈X:\n(i) d(a, b) ⩾0 and d(a, b) = 0 if and only if a = b;\n(ii) d(a, b) = d(b, a); and\n(iii) d(a, c) ⩽d(a, b) + d(b, c), [the triangle inequality] for all a, b and c in X.\nThen d is said to be a metric on X, (X, d) is called a metric space and d(a, b)\nis referred to as the distance between a and b.\n125\n234\nCHAPTER 9.\nCOUNTABLE PRODUCTS\n9.3.10\nCorollary.\nThe Hilbert Cube is metrizable.\nThe proof of Proposition 9.3.9 can be refined to obtain the following result:\n9.3.11\nProposition.\nLet (Xi,τ i), i ∈N, be a countably infinite family of\ncompletely metrizable spaces. Then Q∞\ni=1(Xi,τ i) is completely metrizable.\nProof.\nExercises 9.3 #10.\n9.3.12\nRemark.\nFrom Proposition 9.3.11 we see that a countably infinite\nproduct of discrete spaces is completely metrizable. The most interesting example\nof this is Nℵ0, that is a countably infinite product of topological spaces each\nhomeomorphic to the discrete space N. What is much more surprising is the fact,\nas mentioned in Chapter 6, that N∞is homeomorphic to P, the topological\nspace of all irrational numbers with the euclidean topology.\nSee Engelking\n[130] Exercise 4.3.G and Exercise 6.2.A.\n9.3.13\nRemark.\nAnother important example of a completely metrizable\ncountable product is R∞.\nThis is the countably infinite product of topological\nspaces each homeomorphic to R. Corollary 4.3.25 of Engelking [130] shows that:\na separable metrizable space is completely metrizable if and only if it is\nhomeomorphic to a closed subspace of R∞.\nIn particular we see that every\nseparable Banach space is homeomorphic to a closed subspace of R∞.\nA beautiful and deep result says that: every separable infinite-dimensional\nBanach space is homeomorphic to R∞, see Bessaga and Pelczynski [41].\n"

(See Exercises 4.1\n#13. )\n6.1.24\nDefinition.\nA topological space (X,τ) is said to be a Hausdorff\nspace (or a T2-space) if for each pair of distinct points a and b in X, there\nexist open sets U and V such that a ∈U, b ∈V , and U ∩V = Ø.\nOf course R, R2 and all discrete spaces are examples of Hausdorff spaces, while\nany set with at least 2 elements and which has the indiscrete topology is not a\nHausdorff space. With a little thought we see that Z with the finite-closed topology\nis also not a Hausdorff space. (Convince yourself of all of these facts.)\n6.1.25\nProposition.\nLet (X, d) be any metric space and τ the topology\ninduced on X by d. Then (X,τ) is a Hausdorff space.\nProof.\nLet a and b be any points of X, with a ̸= b.\nThen d(a, b) > 0.\nPut\nε = d(a, b). Consider the open balls Bε/2(a) and Bε/2(b). Then these are open sets\nin (X,τ) with a ∈Bε/2(a) and b ∈Bε/2(b). So to show τ is Hausdorff we have to\nprove only that Bε/2(a) ∩Bε/2(b) = Ø.\nSuppose x ∈Bε/2(a) ∩Bε/2(b). Then d(x, a) < ε\n2 and d(x, b) < ε\n2. Hence\nd(a, b) ⩽d(a, x) + d(x, b)\n< ε\n2 + ε\n2 = ε.\nThis says d(a, b) < ε, which is false. Consequently there exists no x in Bε/2(a) ∩\nBε/2(b); that is, Bε/2(a) ∩Bε/2(b) = Ø, as required.\n□\n6.1.26\nRemark.\nPutting Proposition 6.1.25 together with the comments which\npreceded it, we see that an indiscrete space with at least two points has a topology\nwhich is not induced by any metric.

To verify that f is continuous\nit suffices to show that the inverse image of every closed set in (Y,τ 1) is closed\nin (X,τ). So let A be closed in (Y,τ 1). Let x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . be a sequence of\npoints in f−1(A) convergent to a point x ∈X. As xn →x, f(xn) →f(x). But\nsince each f(xn) ∈A and A is closed, Proposition 6.2.3 then implies that f(x) ∈A.\nThus x ∈f−1(A).\nSo we have shown that every convergent sequence of points\nfrom f−1(A) converges to a point of f−1(A). Thus f−1(A) is closed, and hence f\nis continuous.\nConversely, let f be continuous and xn →x.\nLet ε be any positive real\nnumber. Then the open ball Bε(f(x)) is an open set in (Y,τ 1). As f is continuous,\nf−1(Bε(f(x)) is an open set in (X,τ) and it contains x. Therefore there exists a\nδ > 0 such that\nx ∈Bδ(x) ⊆f−1(Bε(f(x))).\nAs xn →x, there exists a positive integer n0 such that for all n ⩾n0, xn ∈Bδ(x).\nTherefore\nf(xn) ∈f(Bδ(x)) ⊆Bε(f(x)), for all n ⩾n0.\nThus f(xn) →f(x).\n□\nThe Corollary below is easily deduced from Proposition 6.2.4.\n146\nCHAPTER 6.\nMETRIC SPACES\n2.\nLet (X, d) be a metric space and x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . a sequence such that xn →x\nand xn →y.

The following example shows that this\nis not true.\n6.3.3\nExample.\nConsider the open interval (0, 1) with the euclidean metric d.\nIt is clear that the sequence 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, . . . is a Cauchy sequence but it\ndoes not converge to any point in (0, 1).\n□\n6.3.4\nDefinition.\nA metric space (X, d) is said to be complete if every\nCauchy sequence in (X, d) converges to a point in (X, d).\nWe immediately see from Example 6.3.3 that the unit interval (0,1) with the\neuclidean metric is not a complete metric space. On the other hand, if X is any\nfinite set and d is the discrete metric on X, then obviously (X, d) is a complete\nmetric space.\n152\nCHAPTER 6.\nMETRIC SPACES\n6.3.9\nProposition.\nLet {xn} be a monotonic sequence in R with the\neuclidean metric. Then {xn} converges to a point in R if and only if {xn} is\nbounded.\nProof.\nRecall that “bounded” was defined in Remark 3.3.1.\nClearly if {xn} is unbounded, then it does not converge.\nAssume then that {xn} is an increasing sequence which is bounded.\nBy the\nLeast Upper Bound Axiom, there is a least upper bound L of the set {xn : n ∈N}.\nIf ε is any positive real number, then there exists a positive integer N such that\nd(xN, L) < ε; indeed, xN > L −ε.\nBut as {xn} is an increasing sequence and L is an upper bound, we have\nL −ε < xn < L,\nfor all n > N.\nThat is xn →L.\nThe case that {xn} is a decreasing sequence which is bounded is proved in an\nanalogous fashion, which completes the proof.\n□\nAs a corollary to Lemma 6.3.8 and Proposition 6.3.9, we obtain immediately\nthe following:\n6.3.10\nTheorem.\n(Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem)\nEvery bounded\nsequence in R with the euclidean metric has a convergent subsequence.\n□\nAt long last we are able to prove that R with the euclidean metric is a complete\nmetric space.\n154\nCHAPTER 6.\nMETRIC SPACES\nHence xn →a, which completes the proof of the Corollary.\n□\n6.3.12\nCorollary.\nFor each positive integer m, the metric space Rm with\nthe euclidean metric is a complete metric space.\nProof.\nSee Exercises 6.3 #4.\n□\n6.3.13\nProposition.\nLet (X, d) be a metric space, Y a subset of X, and\nd1 the metric induced on Y by d.\n(i) If (X, d) is a complete metric space and Y is a closed subspace of (X, d),\nthen (Y, d1) is a complete metric space.\n(ii) If (Y, d1) is a complete metric space, then Y is a closed subspace of (X, d).\n.\nProof.\nSee Exercises 6.3 #5.\n□\n6.3.14\nRemark.\nNote that Example 6.3.3 showed that (0, 1) with the euclidean\nmetric is not a complete metric space. However, Corollary 6.3.11 showed that R with\nthe euclidean metric is a complete metric space. And we know that the topological\nspaces (0, 1) and R are homeomorphic.\nSo completeness is not preserved by\nhomeomorphism and so is not a topological property.\n6.3.15\nDefinition.\nA topological space (X,τ) is said to be completely\nmetrizable if there exists a metric d on X such that τ is the topology on X\ndetermined by d and (X, d) is a complete metric space.\n6.3.16\nRemark.\nNote that being completely metrizable is indeed a topological\nproperty.\nFurther, it is easy to verify (see Exercises 6.3 #7) that every discrete\nspace and every interval of R with the induced topology is completely metrizable.\nSo for a, b ∈R with a < b, the topological spaces R, [a, b], (a, b), [a, b), (a, b],\n(−∞, a), (−∞, a], (a, ∞), [a, ∞), and {a} with their induced topologies are all\n156\nCHAPTER 6.\nMETRIC SPACES\nWe know that two topological spaces are equivalent if they are homeomorphic.\nIt is natural to ask when are two metric spaces equivalent (as metric spaces)? The\nrelevant concept was introduced in Exercises 6.1 #10, namely that of isometric.\n6.3.20\nDefinition.\nLet (X, d) and (Y, d1) be metric spaces. Then (X, d)\nis said to be isometric to (Y, d1) if there exists a surjective mapping f : X →Y\nsuch that for all x1 and x2 in X, d(x1, x2) = d1(f(x1), f(x2)). Such a mapping\nf is said to be an isometry.\nLet d be any metric on R and a any positive real number. If d1 is defined by\nd1(x, y) = a.d(x, y), for all x, y ∈R, then it is easily shown that (R, d1) is a metric\nspace isometric to (R, d).\nIt is also easy to verify that any two isometric metric spaces have their associated\ntopological spaces homeomorphic and every isometry is also a homeomorphism of\nthe associated topological spaces.\n6.3.21\nDefinition.\nLet (X, d) and (Y, d1) be metric spaces and f a mapping\nof X into Y .\nLet Z = f(X), and d2 be the metric induced on Z by d1.\nIf\nf : (X, d) →(Z, d2) is an isometry, then f is said to be an isometric embedding\nof (X, d) in (Y, d1).\nOf course the natural embedding of Q with the euclidean metric in R with the\neuclidean metric is an isometric embedding.\nIt is also the case that N with the\neuclidean metric has a natural isometric embedding into both R and Q with the\neuclidean metric.\n6.3.22\nDefinition.\nLet (X, d) and (Y, d1) be metric spaces and f a mapping\nof X into Y .\nIf (Y, d1) is a complete metric space, f : (X, d) →(Y, d1) is\nan isometric embedding and f(X) is a dense subset of Y\nin the associated\ntopological space, then (Y, d1) is said to be a completion of (X, d).\nClearly R with the euclidean metric is a completion of Q, the set of rationals\nwith the euclidean metric. Also R with the euclidean metric is a completion of I,\n158\nCHAPTER 6.\nMETRIC SPACES\n6.3.23\nProposition.\nIf (X, d) is a metric space, then it has a completion.\nOutline Proof.\nWe begin by saying that two Cauchy sequences {yn} and {zn} in\n(X, d) are equivalent if d(yn, zn) →0 in R. This is indeed an equivalence relation;\nthat is, it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.\nNow let\neX be the set of all\nequivalence classes of equivalent Cauchy sequences in (X, d).\nWe wish to put a\nmetric on eX.\nLet ˜y and ˜z be any two points in eX.\nLet Cauchy sequences {yn} ∈˜y and\n{zn} ∈˜z. Now the sequence {d(yn, zn)} is a Cauchy sequence in R. (See Exercises\n6.3 #8.) As R is a complete metric space, this Cauchy sequence in R converges to\nsome number, which we shall denote by d1(˜y, ˜z). It is straightforward to show that\nd1(˜y, ˜z) is not dependent on the choice of the sequence {yn} in ˜y and {zn} in ˜z.\nFor each x ∈X, the constant sequence x, x, . . . , x, . . . is a Cauchy sequence in\n(X, d) converging to x. Let ˜x denote the equivalence class of all Cauchy sequences\nconverging to x ∈X.\nDefine the subset Y\nof eX to be {˜x : x ∈X}.\nIf d2 is\nthe metric on Y induced by the metric d1 on eX, then it is clear that the mapping\nf : (X, d) →(Y, d2), given by f(x) = ˜x, is an isometry.\nNow we show that Y is dense in eX. To do this we show that for any given real\nnumber ε > 0, and z ∈eX, there is an ˜x ∈Y , such that d1(z, ˜x) < ε. Note that\nz is an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences. Let {xn} be a Cauchy sequence in\nthis equivalence class z. There exists a positive integer n0, such that for all n > n0,\nd1(xn, xn0) < ε. We now consider the constant sequence xn0, xn0, . . . , xn0, . . . . This\nlies in the equivalence class g\nxn0, which is in Y . Further, d1(g\nxn0, z) < ε. So Y is\nindeed dense in eX.\nFinally, we show that ( eX, d1) is a complete metric space. Let {zn} be a Cauchy\nsequence in this space. We are required to show that it converges in eX. As Y is\ndense, for each positive integer n, there exists f\nxn ∈Y , such that d1(f\nxn, zn) < 1/n.\nWe show that {f\nxn} is a Cauchy sequence in Y .\nConsider a real number ε > 0.\nThere exists a positive integer N, such that\nd1(zn, zm) < ε/2 for n, m > N. Now take a positive integer n1, with 1/n1 < ε/4.\nFor n, m > n1 + N, we have\nd1(f\nxn, f\nxm) < d1(f\nxn, zn) + d1(zn, zm) + d1(zm, f\nxm) < 1/n + ε/2 + 1/m < ε.\nSo {f\nxn} is a Cauchy sequence in Y . This implies that {xn} is a Cauchy sequence\nin (X, d). Hence {xn} ∈z, for some z ∈eX. It is now straightforward to show first\nthat f\nxn →z and then that zn →z, which completes the proof.\n□\n160\nCHAPTER 6.\nMETRIC SPACES\n6.3.26\nExample.\nIn Exercises 6.1 #7 and #8 we introduced the metric spaces\n(ℓ1, d1), (ℓ2, d2), (ℓ∞, d∞), and (c0, d0) and recorded that each can be made into\na normed vector space in a natural way. We use the notation ℓ1, ℓ∞, ℓ2 and c0 to\ndenote these normed spaces. Indeed each of these is a Banach space, and ℓ1, ℓ2,\nand c0 are separable Banach spaces. (See Exercises 6.3 #11.)\nFrom Proposition 6.3.23 we know that every normed vector space has a\ncompletion.

It would be fair to say that until you understand\ncompactness you do not understand topology!\nSo what is compactness? It could be described as the topologists generalization\nof finiteness.\nThe formal definition says that a topological space is compact if\nwhenever it is a subset of a union of an infinite number of open sets then it is also a\nsubset of a union of a finite number of these open sets. Obviously every finite subset\nof a topological space is compact. And we quickly see that in a discrete space a set\nis compact if and only if it is finite. When we move to topological spaces with richer\ntopological structures, such as R, we discover that infinite sets can be compact.\nIndeed all closed intervals [a, b] in R are compact. But intervals of this type are the\nonly ones which are compact.\nSo we are led to ask: precisely which subsets of R are compact? The Heine-\nBorel Theorem 7.2.9 will tell us that the compact subsets of R are precisely the sets\nwhich are both closed and bounded.\nAs we go farther into our study of topology, we shall see that compactness plays\na crucial role. This is especially so of applications of topology to analysis.\n176\n431\nin the Order of the Dutch Lion in 1932.

(Of course this result can also be\ndeduced from Tychonoff’s Theorem 10.3.4 for infinite products, which is proved in\nChapter 10.)\n9.3.8\nTheorem.\nThe Hilbert cube is compact.\nProof.\nBy Proposition 9.3.5, there is a continuous mapping ϕn of (Gn,τ n)\nonto (In,τ ′n) where, for each n ∈N, (Gn,τ n) and (In,τ ′n) are homeomorphic\nto the Cantor Space and [0,1],\nrespectively.\nTherefore by Proposition 9.2.5\nand Exercises 9.2 #2 (b), there is a continuous mapping ψ of Q∞\nn=1(Gn,τ n)\nonto Q∞\nn=1(In,τ ′n) = I∞.\nBut Proposition 9.3.3 says that Q∞\nn=1(Gn,τ n) is\nhomeomorphic to the Cantor Space (G,τ). Therefore I∞is a continuous image of\nthe compact space (G,τ), and hence is compact.\nChapter 10\nTychonoff’s Theorem\nIntroduction\nIn Chapter 9 we defined the product of a countably infinite family of topological\nspaces. We now proceed to define the product of any family of topological spaces\nby replacing the set {1, 2, . . . , n, . . . } by an arbitrary index set I. The central result\nwill be the general Tychonoff Theorem.\nThe reader should be aware that this chapter is more sophisticated and\nchallenging than previous chapters.

So H1ε[0, 1] ⩽ε(2+1/ε);\nthat is, H1ε[0, 1] ⩽1 + 2ε. Thus H1[0, 1] ⩽1. From Example A4.1.23, we now have\nH1[0, 1] = 1, from which the Proposition follows.\n□\nA similar argument to that above shows that if a, b ∈R with a < b, where R has\nthe euclidean metric, then dimH[a, b] = 1.

Then\n(i) each pi is a continuous surjective open mapping, and\n(ii) τ is the coarsest topology on the set X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn such that each\npi is continuous.\nProof.\nClearly each pi is surjective. To see that each pi is continuous, let U be\nany open set in (Xi,τ i). Then\np−1\ni\n(U) = X1 × X2 × · · · × Xi−1 × U × Xi+1 × · · · × Xn\nwhich is a product of open sets and so is open in (X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn,τ). Hence\neach pi is continuous.\nTo show that pi is an open mapping it suffices to verify that for each basic open set\nU1 × U2 × · · · × Un, where Uj is open in (Xj,τ j), for j = 1, . . . , n, the set\npi(U1 × U2 × · · · × Un) is open in (Xi,τ i).\nBut pi(U1 × U2 × · · · × Un) = Ui\nwhich is, of course, open in (Xi,τ i). So each pi is an open mapping. We have now\nverified part (i) of the proposition.\nNow let τ ′ be any topology on the set X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn such that each\nprojection mapping pi : (X1 ×X2 ×· · ·×Xn,τ ′) →(Xi,τ i) is continuous. We have\nto show that τ ′ ⊇T .\nRecalling the definition of the basis for the topology τ (given in Definition\n8.1.1) it suffices to show that if O1, O2, . . . , On\nare open sets in (X1,τ 1),\n(X2,τ 2), . . . , (Xn,τ n) respectively, then O1 × O2 × · · · × On ∈τ ′. To show this,\nobserve that as pi is continuous, p−1\ni\n(Oi) ∈τ ′, for each i = 1, . . . , n. Now\np−1\ni\n(Oi) = X1 × X2 × · · · × Xi−1 × Oi × Xi+1 × · · · × Xn,\nso that\nn\n\\\ni=1\np−1\ni\n(Oi) = O1 × O2 × · · · × On.\nThen p−1\ni\n(Oi) ∈τ ′ for i = 1, . . . , n, implies Tn\ni=1 p−1\ni\n(Oi) ∈τ ′ ;\nthat is, O1 × O2 × · · · × On ∈τ ′, as required.\n□\n202\nCHAPTER 8.\nFINITE PRODUCTS\n8.2.8\nProposition.\nLet (X1,τ 1), (X2,τ 2), . . . , (Xn, Tn) be topological\nspaces\nand\n(X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn,τ)\nthe\nproduct\nspace.\nThen\neach (Xi,τ i)\nis\nhomeomorphic to a subspace of (X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn,τ).\nProof.\nFor each j, let aj be any (fixed) element in Xj.\nFor each i, define a\nmapping\nfi : (Xi,τ i) →(X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn,τ) by\nfi(x) = ⟨a1, a2, . . . , ai−1, x, ai+1, . . . , an⟩.\nWe claim that fi: (Xi,τ i) →(fi(Xi),τ ′) is a homeomorphism, where τ ′ is the\ntopology induced on fi(Xi) by τ . Clearly this mapping is one-to-one and onto. Let\nU ∈τ i. Then\nfi(U) = {a1} × {a2} × · · · × {ai−1} × U × {ai+1} × · · · × {an}\n= (X1 × X2 × · · · × Xi−1 × U × Xi+1 × · · · × Xn) ∩\n({a1} × {a2} × · · · × {ai−1} × Xi × {ai+1} × · · · × {an})\n= (X1 × X2 × · · · × Xi−1 × U × Xi+1 × · · · × Xn) ∩fi(Xi)\n∈τ ′\nsince X1 × X2 × · · · × Xi−1 × U × Xi+1 × · · · × Xn ∈τ . So U ∈τ i implies that\nfi(U) ∈τ ′.\nFinally, observe that the family\n{(U1 × U2 × · · · × Un) ∩fi(Xi) : Ui ∈Ti, i = 1, . . . , n}\nis a basis for τ ′, so to prove that fi is continuous it suffices to verify that the\ninverse image under fi of every member of this family is open in (Xi,τ i).

Then for each x ∈X and y ∈Y , there\nexists an i ∈I such that ⟨x, y⟩∈Ui. So there is a basic open set V (x, y) × W(x, y),\nsuch that V ⟨x, y⟩∈τ 1, W(x, y) ∈τ 2 and ⟨x, y⟩∈V (x, y) × W(x, y) ⊆Ui.\nAs ⟨x, y⟩ranges over all points of X × Y we obtain an open covering V (x, y) ×\nW(x, y), x ∈X, y ∈Y , of X × Y such that each V (x, y) × W(x, y) is a subset of\nsome Ui, i ∈I. Thus to prove (X,τ 1) × (Y,τ 2) is compact it suffices to find a\nfinite subcovering of the open covering V (x, y) × W(x, y), x ∈X, y ∈Y .\nNow fix x0 ∈X and consider the subspace {x0} × Y of X × Y .\nAs seen in\nProposition 8.2.8 this subspace is homeomorphic to (Y,τ 2) and so is compact.\nAs V (x0, y) × W(x0, y), y ∈Y , is an open covering of {x0} × Y\nit has a finite\nsubcovering:\nV (x0, y1) × W(x0, y1), V (x0, y2) × W(x0, y2), . . . , V (x0, ym) × W(x0, ym).\nPut V (x0) = V (x0, y1) ∩V (x0, y2) ∩· · · ∩V (x0, ym). Then we see that the\nset V (x0) × Y\nis contained in the union of a finite number of sets of the form\nV (x0, y) × W(x0, y), y ∈Y.\nThus to prove X × Y is compact it suffices to show that X × Y is contained in\na finite union of sets of the form V (x) × Y . As each V (x) is an open set containing\nx ∈X, the family V (x), x ∈X, is an open covering of the compact space (X,τ 1).\nTherefore there exist x1, x2, . . . , xk such that X ⊆V (x1) ∪V (x2) ∪. . . V (xk). Thus\nX × Y ⊆(V (x1) × Y ) ∪(V (x2) × Y ) ∪· · · ∪(V (xk) × Y ), as required.\nHence\n(X,τ 1) × (Y,τ 2) is compact.\nThe proof is completed by induction.

If O ∩Cj = Cj for\nsome j ∈I, then x ∈O.\nSo, in this case, O ∩Ci ̸= Ø, for all i ∈I as each Ci\ncontains x. Therefore O ∩Ci = Ci, for all i ∈I or O ∩Ci = Ø, for all i ∈I; that\nis, O = CX(x) or O = Ø.\nSo CX(x) has no proper non-empty clopen subset and hence is connected.\n□\n8.4.3\nRemark.\nWe see from Definition 8.4.1 and Proposition 8.4.2 that CX(x)\nis the largest connected subset of X which contains x.\n□\n216\nCHAPTER 8.\nFINITE PRODUCTS\n8.4.6\nRemark.\nIn Exercises 5.2 #9 the following result appears:\nFor any\npoint x in any topological space (X,τ), the component CX(x) is a closed\nset.\n□\n8.4.7\nDefinition.\nA topological space is said to be a continuum if it is\ncompact and connected.\nAs an immediate consequence of Theorem 8.3.1 and Propositions 8.4.5 and\n8.3.2 we have the following proposition.\n8.4.8\nProposition.\nLet (X1,τ 1), (X2,τ 2), . . . , (Xn,τ n) be topological\nspaces.\nThen Qn\ni=1(Xi,τ i) is a continuum if and only if each (Xi,τ i) is a\ncontinuum.\n□\nExercises 8.4\nCompactum\n1.

The easiest case is that of finite products. In the next chapter we study\ncountably infinite products and in Chapter 10, the general case. The most important\nresult proved in this section is Tychonoff’s Theorem 8.3.11. In Chapter 10 this is\ngeneralized to arbitrary sized products.\nThe second result we called a theorem here is the Generalized Heine-Borel\nTheorem 8.3.3 which characterizes the compact subsets of Rn as those which are\nclosed and bounded.\nExercises 8.3 #1 introduced the notion of locally compact topological space.\nSuch spaces play a central role in topological group theory. (See Appendix 5.)\nOur study of connectedness has been furthered in this section by defining the\ncomponent of a point.\nThis allows us to partition any topological space into\nconnected sets. In a connected space like Rn the component of any point is the whole\nspace. At the other end of the scale, the components in any totally disconnected\nspace, for example, Q, are all singleton sets.\nAs mentioned above, compactness has a local version. So too does connectedness.\nExercises 8.4 #5 defined locally connected.\nHowever, while every compact space\nis locally compact, not every connected space is locally connected.\nIndeed many\nproperties P have local versions called locally P, and P usually does not imply\nlocally P and locally P usually does not imply P.\nTowards the end of the chapter we gave a topological proof of the Fundamental\nTheorem of Algebra 8.5.1. The fact that a theorem in one branch of mathematics\ncan be proved using methods from another branch is but one indication of why\nmathematics should not be compartmentalized.\nWhile you may have separate\ncourses on algebra, complex analysis, and number theory these topics are, in fact,\ninterrelated.\nIn Appendix 5 we introduce the notion of a topological group, that is a set with\nthe structure of both a topological space and a group, and with the two structures\nrelated in an appropriate manner. Topological group theory is a rich and interesting\n1You should have noticed how sparingly we use the word “theorem”, so when we do use that term\nit is because the result is important.\n"

You are familiar with the decimal expansion of real numbers\nwhich uses base 10. Today one cannot avoid computers which use base 2. But for\nthe Cantor Set, base 3 is what is best.\nIn the ternary system, 76 5\n81 would be written as 2211·0012, since this represents\n2.33 + 2.32 + 1.31 + 1.30 + 0.3−1 + 0.3−2 + 1.3−3 + 2.3−4.\nSo a number x in [0, 1] is represented by the base 3 number ·a1a2a3 . . . an . . . , where\nx =\n∞\nX\nn=1\nan\n3n,\nan ∈{0, 1, 2},\nfor each n ∈N.\nSo as 1\n2 = P∞\nn=1\n1\n3n, 1\n3 = P∞\nn=2\n2\n3n, and 1 = P∞\nn=1\n2\n3n, we see that their ternary\nforms are given by\n1\n2 = 0·11111 . . . ;\n1\n3 = 0·02222 . . . ;\n1 = 0·2222 . . . .\n(Of course another ternary expression for 1\n3 is 0·10000 . . .\nand another for 1 is\n1·0000 . . . .)\nTurning again to the Cantor Set, G, it should be clear that an element of [0, 1]\nis in G if and only if it can be written in ternary form with an ̸= 1, for every n ∈N.\nSo 1\n2 /∈G, 5\n81 /∈G, 1\n3 ∈G, and 1 ∈G.\nThus we have a function f from the Cantor Set into the set of all sequences\nof the form ⟨a1, a2, a3, . . . , an, . . . ⟩, where each ai ∈{0, 2} and f is one-to-one and\nonto.

(See Exercises 2.2 #4.)\n9.4.14\nDefinition.\nA topological space (X,τ) is said to satisfy the second\naxiom of countability (or to be second countable) if there exists a basis B\nfor τ such that B consists of only a countable number of sets.\n9.4.15\nExample.\nLet B = {(q −1\nn, q + 1\nn) : q ∈Q, n ∈N}. Then B is a basis\nfor the euclidean topology on R. (Verify this). Therefore R is second countable. □\n9.4.16\nExample.\nLet (X,τ) be an uncountable set with the discrete topology.\nThen, as every singleton set must be in any basis for τ , (X,τ) does not have any\ncountable basis. So (X,τ) is not second countable.\n□\n9.4.17\nProposition.\nLet (X, d) be a metric space and τ the induced\ntopology. Then (X,τ) is a separable space if and only if it satisfies the second\naxiom of countability.\nProof.\nLet (X,τ) be separable. Then it has a countable dense subset Y = {yi :\ni ∈N}. Let B consist of all the open balls (in the metric d) with centre yi, for some\ni, and radius 1\nn, for some positive integer n.\nClearly B is countable and we shall\nshow that it is a basis for τ .\nLet V ∈τ . Then for any v ∈V , V contains an open ball, B, of radius 1\nn about\nv, for some n. As Y is dense in X, there exists a ym ∈Y , such that d(ym, v) < 1\n2n.\nLet B′ be the open ball with centre ym and radius\n1\n2n. Then the triangle inequality\nimplies B′ ⊆B ⊆V . Also B′ ∈B. Hence B is a basis for τ . So (X,τ) is second\ncountable.\n244\nCHAPTER 9.\nCOUNTABLE PRODUCTS\n2. If (Xi,τ i), i ∈N, are separable spaces, prove that Q∞\ni=1(Xi,τ i) is a separable\nspace.\n3.

In fact, every compact metric\nspace is a continuous image of the Cantor Space. The next proposition is a step in\nthis direction.\n250\nCHAPTER 9.\nCOUNTABLE PRODUCTS\nwhich is a contradiction. So there exists a unique element of Y which is closest to\ng. Call this element ψ(g).\nIt is clear that the map ψ: (G′,τ ′) −→(Y,τ 1) is surjective, since for each\ny ∈Y , ψ(y) = y. To prove continuity of ψ, let g ∈G′. Let ε be any given positive\nreal number. Then it suffices, by Corollary 6.2.4, to find a δ > 0, such that if x ∈G′\nand |g −x| < δ then |ψ(g) −ψ(x)| < ε.\nConsider firstly the case when g ∈Y , so ψ(g) = g. Put δ = ε\n2. Then for x ∈G′\nwith |g −x| < δ we have\n|ψ(g) −ψ(x)| = |g −ψ(x)|\n⩽|x −ψ(x)| + |g −x|\n⩽|x −g| + |g −x|, by definition of ψ since g ∈Y\n= 2|x −g|\n< 2δ\n= ε, as required.\nNow consider the case when g /∈Y , so g ̸= ψ(g).\nWithout loss of generality, assume ψ(g) < g and put a = g −ψ(g).\nIf the set Y ∩[g, 1] = Ø, then ψ(x) = ψ(g) for all x ∈(g −a\n2, g + a\n2).\nThus for δ < a\n2, we have |ψ(x) −ψ(g)| = 0 < ε, as required.\nIf Y ∩[g, 1] ̸= Ø, then as Y ∩[g, 1] is compact it has a least element y > g.\nIndeed by the definition of ψ, if b = y −g, then b > a.\nNow put δ = b−a\n2 .\nSo if x ∈G′ with |g −x| < δ, then either ψ(x) = ψ(g) or ψ(x) = y. Observe that\n|x −ψ(g)| ⩽|x −g| + |g −ψ(g)| < δ + a = b −a\n2\n+ a = b\n2 + a\n2\nwhile\n|x −y| ⩾|g −y| −|g −x| ⩾b −b −a\n2\n= b\n2 + a\n2.\nSo ψ(x) = ψ(g).\nThus |ψ(x) −ψ(g)| = 0 < ε, as required. Hence ψ is continuous.\n□\nThus we obtain from Propositions 9.5.2 and 9.5.3 the following theorem of\nAlexandroff and Urysohn:\n252\nCHAPTER 9.\nCOUNTABLE PRODUCTS\n9.5.7\nCorollary.\nLet (X,τ) be a Hausdorff space. Then it is a continuous\nimage of the Cantor Space if and only if it is compact and metrizable.\nFinally in this chapter we turn to space-filling curves.\n9.5.8\nRemark.\nEveryone thinks he or she knows what a “curve” is. Formally\nwe can define a curve in R2 to be the set f[0, 1], where f is a continuous map\nf : [0, 1] −→R2. It seems intuitively clear that a curve has no breadth and hence\nzero area. This is false! In fact there exist space-filling curves; that is, f(I) has non-\nzero area. Indeed the next theorem shows that there exists a continuous mapping\nof [0, 1] onto the product space [0, 1] × [0, 1].\n9.5.9\nTheorem.\n(Peano)\nFor each positive integer n, there exists a\ncontinuous mapping ψn of [0, 1] onto the n-cube In.\nProof.\nBy Theorem 9.5.4, there exists a continuous mapping ϕn of the Cantor\nSpace (G,τ) onto the n-cube In. As (G,τ) is obtained from [0, 1] by successively\ndropping out middle thirds, we extend ϕn to a continuous mapping ψn : [0, 1] −→In\nby defining ψn to be linear on each omitted interval; that is, if (a, b) is one of the\nopen intervals comprising [0, 1] \\ G, then ψn is defined on (a, b) by\nψn (αa + (1 −α) b) = α ϕn(a) + (1 −α) ϕn(b),\n0 ⩽α ⩽1.\nIt is easily verified that ψn is continuous.\nWe conclude this chapter by stating (but not proving) the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz\nTheorem which characterizes those Hausdorff spaces which are continuous images\nof [0,1].\n[For a proof of the theorem see Wilder [426] and p. 221 of Kuratowski\n[249].] But first we need a definition.\n254\nCHAPTER 9.\nCOUNTABLE PRODUCTS\nExercises 9.5\n1.

The proof of the countable Tychonoff Theorem\nfor metrizable spaces presented here is quite different from the standard one which\nappears in the next section. Our proof relies on the Cantor Space.\nThe Cantor Space was defined to be a certain subspace of [0, 1]. Later it was\nshown that it is homeomorphic to a countably infinite product of 2-point discrete\nspaces.\nThe Cantor Space appears to be the kind of pathological example pure\nmathematicians are fond of producing in order to show that some general statement\nis false. But it turns out to be much more than this.\nThe Alexandroff-Urysohn Theorem 9.5.4 says that every compact metrizable\nspace is an image of the Cantor Space. In particular [0, 1] and the Hilbert cube (a\ncountable infinite product of copies of [0, 1]) is a continuous image of the Cantor\nSpace. This leads us to the existence of space-filling curves – in particular, we show\nthat there exists a continuous map of [0, 1] onto the cube [0, 1]n, for each positive\ninteger n. We stated, but did not prove, the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz Theorem 9.5.12:\nThe Hausdorff space (X,τ) is an image of [0, 1] if and only if it is compact connected\nlocally connected and metrizable.\nNext we mention Urysohn’s Theorem 9.4.19, which says that a space is separable\nand metrizable if and only if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Hilbert cube.\nThis shows that [0, 1] is not just a “nice” topological space, but a “generator” of\nthe important class of separable metrizable spaces via the formation of subspaces\nand countable products.\nFinally we mention a beautiful and deep theorem related to countably infinite\nproducts which we have not proved in this chapter. For proofs of this theorem and\ndiscussion, see Anderson and Bing [12],Toru`nczyk [398], and Bessaga and Pelczynski\n[41]. We include a few related and surprising results from Bessaga and Pelczynski\n[41]; for example, the open unit ball, the closed unit ball, the unit sphere, any\nnon-empty open convex subset, and any closed convex set with non-empty\ninterior in a separable infinite-dimensional Banach space B are homeomorphic\nto each other and to the whole space B.\nNote that, within the context of topological vector spaces a Frechet space is\na complete metrizable locally convex topological vector space.\n258\nCHAPTER 9.\nCOUNTABLE PRODUCTS\n9.6.7\nCorollary.

Then\nF is said to have the finite intersection property or (F.I.P.) if for any finite\nnumber F1, F2, . . . , Fn of members of F, F1 ∩F2 ∩· · · ∩Fn ̸= Ø.\n274\nCHAPTER 10.\nTYCHONOFF’S THEOREM\n10.3.4\nTheorem.\n(Tychonoff’s Theorem)\nLet {(Xi,τ i) : i ∈I} be\nany family of topological spaces. Then Q\ni∈I(Xi,τ i) is compact if and only if\neach (Xi,τ i) is compact.\nProof.\nWe shall use Proposition 10.3.2 to show that (X,τ) = Q\ni∈I(Xi,τ i) is\ncompact, if each (Xi,τ i) is compact. Let F be any family of closed subsets of X\nwith the finite intersection property. We have to prove that T\nF∈F F ̸= Ø.\nBy Lemma 10.3.3 there is a maximal family H of (not necessarily closed) subsets\nof (X,τ) that contains F and has the finite intersection property. We shall prove\nthat T\nH∈H H ̸= Ø, from which follows the required result T\nF∈F F ̸= Ø, since each\nF ∈F is closed.\nAs H is maximal with the property that it contains F and has the finite\nintersection property, if H1, H2, . . . , Hn ∈H, for any n ∈N, then the set H′ =\nH1∩H2∩· · ·∩Hn ∈H. Suppose this was not the case. Then the set H′ = H∪{H′}\nwould properly contain H and also have the property that it contains F and has the\nfinite intersection property. This is a contradiction to H being maximal. So H′ = H\nand H′ = H1 ∩H2 ∩· · · ∩Hn ∈H.\nLet S be any subset of X that intersects non-trivially every member of H. We\nclaim that H∪{S} has the finite intersection property. To see this let H′\n1, H′\n2, . . . , H′m\nbe members of H. We shall show that S ∩H′\n1 ∩H′\n2 ∩. . . H′m ̸= Ø. By the previous\nparagraph, H′\n1 ∩H′\n2 ∩. . . H′m ∈H. So by assumption S ∩(H′\n1 ∩H′\n2 ∩. . . H′m) ̸= Ø.\nHence H ∪{S} has the finite intersection property and contains F.\nAgain using\nthe fact that H is maximal with the property that it contains F and has the finite\nintersection property, we see that S ∈H.\nFix i ∈I and let pi : Q\ni∈I(Xi,τ i) →(Xi,τ i) be the projection mapping. Then\nthe family {pi(H) : H ∈H} has the finite intersection property.\nTherefore the\nfamily {pi(H) : H ∈H} has the finite intersection property. As (Xi, Ti) is compact,\nT\nH∈H pi(H) ̸= Ø. So let xi ∈T\nH∈H pi(H). Then for each i ∈I, we can find a\npoint xi ∈T\nH∈H pi(H). Put x = Q\ni∈I xi ∈X.\nWe shall prove that x ∈T\nh∈H H. Let O be any open set containing x. Then\nO contains a basic open set about x of the form T\ni∈J p−1\ni\n(Ui), where Ui ∈τ i,\nxi ∈Ui and J is a finite subset of I.\nAs xi ∈pi(H), Ui ∩pi(H) ̸= Ø, for all\nH ∈H. Thus p−1\ni\n(Ui) ∩H ̸= Ø, for all H ∈H. By the observation above, this\nimplies that p−1\ni\n(Ui) ∈H, for all i ∈J. As H has the finite intersection property,\nT\ni∈J p−1\ni\n(U1) ∩H ̸= Ø, for all H ∈H.\nSo O ∩H ̸= Ø for all H ∈H.\nHence\nx ∈T\nH∈H H, as required.\nConversely, if Q\nI∈I(Xi,τ i) is compact, then by Propositions 7.2.1 and 10.1.5\n(i) each (Xi,τ i) is compact.\n□\n276\nCHAPTER 10.\nTYCHONOFF’S THEOREM\n10.3.9\nProposition.\nLet (X, d) be a metric space and τ the topology\ninduced on X by d.

Then (X,τ) has a dense subspace of cardinality ⩽m.\nProof.\nLet M\nbe a set with card M = m.\nThe power set P(M) has\ncard (P(M)) = 2m.\nWe are required to find a dense subset Y of (X,τ) of cardinality ⩽m.\nIt suffices to find a set S and a function ϕ : S →X with ϕ(S) a dense\nsubset of (X,τ) and card (S) = m.\nLet F(M) be the set of all finite subsets of M. So card (F(M)) = m. (Exercise.)\nLet F(F(M)) be the set of all finite subsets of F(M). Then card (F(F(M))) = m.\nPut S = F(M) × F(F(M)). So card (S) = m.\nWe are now looking for a function ϕ of S into X.\nRecall that X = {0, 1}2m = {0, 1}P(M), and {0, 1}P(M) is the set of all\nfunctions from P(M) to {0, 1}.\nSo for every subset T of S, ϕ(T) is a function from P(M) to {0, 1}.\nLet N be a subset of M; that is, N ∈P(M).\nFurther, let F ∈F(M) and\nF ∈F(F(M)).\nDefine ϕ : S →X by\nϕ(F, F)(N) =\n\u001a1,\nif N ∩F ∈F\n0,\nif N ∩F /∈F.\nLet x ∈X and let Nj, j ∈J, be a finite number of distinct subsets of M.\nPut K = {(j1, j2) : j1, j2 ∈J, j1 ̸= j2} and for each (j1, j2) ∈K, define\nTj1j2 = (Nj1 ∪Nj2) \\ (Nj1 ∩Nj2).\nLet σ : K →\nS\n(j1,j2)∈K\nTj1,j2 be any map such that σ(j1, j2) ∈Tj1j2, (j1, j2) ∈K.\nSet F = {Nj ∩σ(K) : j ∈J and x(Nj) = 1}.\n[Recall that x ∈{0, 1}P(M), that is x is a mapping from P(M) to {0, 1}.]\nThen it is readily verified that ϕ(σ(K), F)(Nj) = x(Nj), for all j ∈J, which\ncompletes the proof.2\n□\n2The proof here of this proposition is based on that in Blair [46] which is closely related to that of\nTheorem 9.2 of Gillman and Jerison [156] that every infinite set, X, has 22card (X) distinct ultrafilters.\nSee also Proposition A6.4.11.\n290\nCHAPTER 10.\nTYCHONOFF’S THEOREM\n10.3.41\nTheorem.\n(Hewitt-Marczewski-Pondiczery Theorem) Let m\nbe an infinite cardinal number, I a set of cardinality less than or equal to 2m,\nand (Xi,τ i), i ∈I, topological spaces each of density character less than or\nequal to m. Then the density character of the product space Q\ni∈I\n(Xi,τ i) is less\nthan or equal to m.\nIn particular, if (X,τ) is any topological space of density character less than or\nequal to m, then the density character of the product space (X,τ)2m is less\nthan or equal to m.\nProof.\nBy Proposition 10.3.40 each (Xi,τ i) has a dense subset which is a\ncontinuous image of the discrete space (D,τ d) of cardinality m and so Q\ni∈I\n(Xi,τ i)\nhas a dense subset which is a continuous image of the product space (D,τ d)2m.\nAs (D,τ d)2m has a dense subset of cardinality less than or equal to m, the product\nspace Q\ni∈I\n(Xi,τ i) also has a dense subset of cardinality less than or equal to m; that\nis, it has density character less than or equal to m.\n□\n10.3.42\nCorollary.\nIf (X,τ) is a separable topological space, then (X,τ)c\nis a separable space.

By our assumption, ϕ−1(U1)∩ϕ−1(U2) = Ø. Putting O1 = X\\ϕ−1(U1)\nand O2 = X \\ ϕ−1(U2), we have X = O1 ∪O2. So x ∈Oj for j = 1 or j = 2. Since\nUj∩ϕ(S\\ϕ−1(Uj) = Ø and Uj is an open set in (K,τ), we have Uj∩ϕ(S \\ ϕ−1(Uj) =\nØ, which implies that yj /∈ϕ(S \\ ϕ−1(Uj)) = ϕ(S ∩Oj) ∈F(x). By (3), then,\nyj /∈Φ(x). This is a contradiction and so our supposition was false, and Φ(x) is a\nsingle point for each x ∈X.\nOur final task is to show that Φ : (X,τ) →(K,τ 2) is continuous. Let U be an\nopen neighbourhood of Φ(x) in (K,τ 2). By (1) and (3),\n{Φ(x)} =\n\\\nN∈N(x)\nϕ(S ∩N) ⊆U\n(4).\nThis implies that\nS\nN∈N(x)\n(K \\ ϕ(S ∩N) ⊇K \\ U.

Indeed it is usual, in\nthis case, to identify X with βX, and so regard (X,τ) as a subspace of\n(βX,τ ′). We, then, do not mention the embedding β and talk about (βX,τ ′) as\nthe Stone-˘Cech compactification.\n□\n334\nCHAPTER 10.\nTYCHONOFF’S THEOREM\n10.4.13\nProposition.\nLet N have its discrete subspace topology in R and\nlet βR be the Stone-˘Cech compactification of R. If the closure in βR of N is\ndenoted by clβRN, then clβRN is βN, the Stone-˘Cech compactification of N.\nProof.\nLet θ be any continuous map of N into [0, 1]. By the Tietze Extension\nTheorem 10.3.51, there is a continuous extension ϕ : R →[0, 1] of θ. Therefore there\nexists a continuous extension Φ : βR →[0, 1] of ϕ.\nSo Φ|clβR(N), the restriction\nof the map Φ to clβRN, maps clβRN to [0, 1] and is a continuous extension of θ.\nAs N is dense in clβRN, this is the unique continuous extension. So by Proposition\n10.4.12, clβRN is βN.\n□\n10.4.14\nRemark.\nIt can be proved in a similar manner to that in Proposition\n10.4.13 that clβQN = βN.\n□\n10.4.15\nProposition.\nLet (X,τ) be any separable topological space.\nThen card βX ⩽card βN.\nProof.\nAs (X,τ) is separable, it has a a dense countable subspace (Y,τ 1).\nSo there exists a continuous surjective map γ : N →(Y,τ 1).\nThus there exists\na continuous map Φ : βN →βX which has dense image in βX.\nBut as the\nimage is compact and βX is Hausdorff, Φ(βN) = βX, from which the proposition\nimmediately follows.\n□\n10.4.16\nProposition.\ncard βN = card βQ = card βR.\nProof.\nThis follows immediately from Propositions 10.4.15 and 10.4.13 and\nRemark 10.4.14.\n□\n336\nCHAPTER 10.\nTYCHONOFF’S THEOREM\nExercises 10.4\n1. Let (X,τ) by a Tychonoff space and (βX,τ ′) its Stone-˘Cech compactification.\nProve that (X,τ) is connected if and only if (βX,τ ′) is connected.\n[Hint: Firstly verify that providing (X,τ) has at least 2 points it is connected if\nand only if there does not exist a continuous map of (X,τ) onto the discrete\nspace {0, 1}.]\n2. Let (X,τ) be a Tychonoff space and (βX,τ ′) its Stone-˘Cech compactification.\nIf (A,τ 1) is a subspace of (βX,τ ′) and A ⊇X, prove that (βX,τ ′) is also the\nStone-˘Cech compactification of (A,τ 1).\n[Hint: Verify that every continuous mapping of (X,τ) into [0, 1] can be extended\nto a continuous mapping of (A,τ 1) into [0, 1].\nThen use the construction of\n(βX,τ ′).]\n3. Let (X,τ) be a dense subspace of a compact Hausdorff space (Z,τ 1).\nIf\nevery continuous mapping of (X,τ) into [0, 1] can be extended to a continuous\nmapping of (Z,τ 1) into [0, 1], prove that (Z,τ 1) is the Stone-˘Cech compactification\nof (X,τ).\n4. Prove that card β(0, 1) = card β(0, 1] = card βP = 2c, where P is the topological\nspace of irrational numbers with the euclidean topology.\n5. Prove Proposition 10.4.18 and Corollary 10.4.19.\n6. Is it true that if X is an unbounded set in an infinite-dimensional normed vector\nspace, then card (βX) ⩾2c?\n7. Using a similar method to that in the proof of Proposition 10.4.17, prove\nCorollary 10.4.20.\n338\nCHAPTER 10.\nTYCHONOFF’S THEOREM\ndimensional reflexive Banach space has a quotient Banach space which is a separable\nand infinite-dimensional Banach space.

Let\nY be the set of all equivalence classes of ∼.\nWe can denote Y by X/ ∼.\nThe\nnatural topology to put on the set Y = X/ ∼is the quotient topology under the\nmap which identifies the equivalence classes; that is, maps each equivalence class\nto a point.\nBecause of this example, quotient mappings are often called identification\nmappings and quotient spaces are often called identification spaces.\nOf course, as we have seen in Remark 11.2.3, this example is in fact quite\ngeneral, because if f is any mapping of a set X onto a set Y , we can define an\nequivalence relation by putting a ∼b if and only if f(a) = f(b), where a, b ∈X.\n□\n11.2.5\nDefinition.\nFor any space (X,τ), the cone (CX,τ 1) over X is\nthe quotient space ((X,τ) × I)/ ∼, where I denotes the unit interval with its\nusual topology and ∼is the equivalence relation (x, 0) ∼(x′, 0), for all x, x′ ∈X;\nthat is, CX = ((X,τ) × I)/(X × {0}).\n11.2.6\nRemark.\nIntuitively1, CX is obtained from X × I by pinching X × {0}\nto a single point. So we make X into a cylinder and collapse one end to a point.\nThe elements of CX are denoted by ⟨x, a⟩. It is readily verified that x 7→⟨x, 1⟩is a\nhomeomorphism of (X,τ) onto its image in (CX,τ 1); that is, it is an embedding.\nSo we identify (X,τ) with the subspace {⟨x, 1⟩: x ∈X} ⊂(CX,τ 1).\n□\n1A useful introductory book on algebraic topology covering topics such as cone and suspension is\n“Algebraic Topology” by Allen Hatcher and is freely downloadable from\nhttp://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf.

By Tychonoff’s Theorem 8.3.1 Sn−1 ×I is compact, and\nso Proposition 11.1.10 implies f is a quotient mapping. As f−1{0} = Sn−1 × {0},\nEn−1 is homeomorphic to CSn.\n□\n11.2.11\nDefinition.\nFor any topological space (X,τ) the suspension,\n(SX,τ 2), is the quotient space of the cone (CX,τ 1) obtained by identifying\nthe points X × {1}; that is,\nSX = CX/(X × {1}) = ([(X,τ) × I]/[X × {0}])/(X × {1}).\n.\nThus (SX,τ 2) is the quotient space of (X,τ) × I where the equivalence relation is\n(x, 1) ∼(x′, 1) and (x, 0) ∼(x′, 0), for all x, x′ ∈X.\nIntuitively, SX is obtained from X × I by pinching each of the sets X × {0} and\nX × {1}.\nIf the space (X,τ) is a circle, then the diagram below is a representation of\nSX.\n348\nCHAPTER 11.\nQUOTIENT SPACES\nExercises 11.2\n1.

Prove\nthat ΓSn−1 ∼= En and that ΣSn−1 ∼= Sn, for any positive integer n ⩾2.\n6. Let (X,τ) be the topological space obtained from the real line R with the\neuclidean topology by indentifying the set of all integers to a point; that is\nn ∼m if and only if n, m ∈Z. Prove that (X,τ) is a sequential space which is\nnot a first countable space. (See Exercises 6.2 #11.)\n11.3\nMöbius Strip, Klein Bottle and Real Projective Space\n11.3.1\nRemark.\nIt is not always easy to picture a 3-dimensional object, let\nalone a 4-dimensional one which cannot exist in 3-dimensional space, such as the\nKlein bottle.\nIt is therefore useful and convenient to use 2-dimensional polygonal\nrepresentations of figures in higher dimensions, where we adopt a convention for\nwhen edges are identified. A simple example will demonstrate how this is done.\n350\nCHAPTER 11.\nQUOTIENT SPACES\n11.3.3\nExample.\nThe Möbius strip or Möbius band, denoted by M, is\ndefined to be the quotient space I × I/ ∼, where ∼is the equivalence relation\n(t, 0) ∼(1 −t, 1), for all t ∈I.\nIf an insect crawled once around the core circle of the Möbius strip (as pictured on\nthe right above) it would return to the “start” but would be its mirror image; if it\ncrawled twice around the core circle of the Möbius strip, it would return to its exact\ninitial position in space.\n□\n352\nCHAPTER 11.\nQUOTIENT SPACES\n11.3.5\nExample.\nThe quotient space I × I/ ∼, where ∼is the equivalence\nrelation (0, t) ∼(1, t) and (t, 0) ∼(1 −t, 1), is called the Klein bottle2, denoted by\nK.\nLike the real projective plane in Examples 11.3.4, the Klein bottle cannot be\nembedded in 3-dimensional euclidean space (without crossing itself), but it can\nbe embedded in R4.\nThis is far from trivial to prove.\nFor a discussion see [361,\n10.2.4, 10.2.5, and 10.2.6].\n□\nExercises 11.3\n1.

Clearly a < s ⩽b.\nThe proof of the Theorem will be complete if we can prove that s = b.\nBy continuity of f at s, there is a δ > 0 such that\n|f(x) −f(s)| ⩽ε\n3 , for s −δ ⩽x ⩽s + δ and a ⩽x ⩽b.\n(9)\nBy the definition of supremum, there is a c with s −δ ⩽c ⩽s and c ∈Sε.

(See Bernstein\nbasis polynomials in Exercises 10.3 #28.)\nSo Bernstein polynomials provide a\nvery concrete and practical method of approximating continuous functions.\nWe will see this is extemely useful in Remark 12,1.7.\nNoting that for any a0, a1, a2, . . . , an ∈R, there exists a continuous function\nf : [0, 1] →R with f\n\u0000m\nn\n\u0001 = am, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n (Exrercises 12.1 #5) we\nsee that every polynomial\nnP\nm=0\nam\n\u0000m\nn\n\u0001xm(1 −x)n−m is the Bernstein polynomial\nof degree nassociated with some continuous function f : [0, 1] →R. But, noting\nExercises 10.3 #28 (ix), we see that every polynomial can be written in this form. So\nevery polynomial is the Bernstein polynomial associated with some continuous\nfunction f : [0, 1] →R.\n366\nCHAPTER 12.\nTHE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM\n12.1.9\nProposition.\nLet C[0, 1] be the set of all continuous functions of\n[0, 1] into R.

We immediately saw generalizations of this,\nnamely that the smaller set of all Bernstein polynomials is dense in C([0, 1], R) as is\nthe set of all polynomials with rational number coefficients. So we might ask: which\nsubsets of C([0, 1], R) are dense? But we shall see much more.\nThe Stone-Weierstrass Theorem addresses the more general problem of identifiying\nthe dense subsets of C(X, R) and C(X, C), where X is a compact Hausdorff space.\nThe Weierstrass Approximation Theorem 12.1.5 is a special case.\nTo address this problem we shall introduce some new concepts and definitions\nwhich are of importance in their own right. First, we make an insightful observation.\n376\nCHAPTER 12.\nTHE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM\n12.2.3\nProposition.\nLet (X,τ) be a compact Hausdorff space, F equal\nto R or C, and S a subset of C(X, F), the set of all continuous function of\n(X,τ) into F with the topology induced by the supremum metric. If S is dense\nin C(X, F), then S separates points of X.\nProof.\nSuppose S does not separate points of X. Then there exist a, b ∈X with\na ̸= b such that ϕ(a) = ϕ(b), for all ϕ ∈S. As S is dense in C(X, F), for each ε > 0\nand each f ∈C(X, F), there exists a ϕ ∈S such that\nsup\nx∈X\n|f(x) −ϕ(x)| < ε.\nAs X is compact Hausdorff, there is a continuous function f ∈C(X, F) such\nthat f(a) = 0 and f(b) = 1, and put ε = 1\n3. So we have\n|f(a) −ϕ(a)| < ε = 1\n3,\n(19)\nand |f(b) −ϕ(b)| < ε = 1\n3.\n(20)\nNow 1 = |f(b) −f(a)| = |(f(b) −ϕ(b)) + (ϕ(b) −f(a))|\n= |(f(b) −ϕ(b)) + (ϕ(a) −f(a))|, as ϕ(a) = ϕ(b)\n⩽|f(b) −ϕ(b)| + |ϕ(a) −f(a)|\n< 2\n3, by (19) and (20).\nAs it is not true that 1 < 2\n3, we have a contradiction and so our supposition that\nS does not separate points of C(X, F) is false, which completes the proof of the\nproposition.\n378\nCHAPTER 12.\nTHE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM\n12.2.7\nDefinition.\nLet S be a subset of an algebra A.\nIf S is itself an\nalgebra with the operations of addition of vectors, scalar multiplication, and the\nbinary operation · of A, then S is called a subalgebra of A.\n12.2.8\nExample.\n(i) The set P of all polynomials on [0, 1] is a unital subalgebra of the algebra\n(C[0, 1], R);\n(ii) The set of all Bernstein polynomials on [0, 1] is a unital subalgebra of the algebra\n(C[0, 1], R);\n(iii) Let A be a subalgebra of (C[0, 1], R) containing the identity function fI and the\nconstant function f1, where fI is given by fI(x) = x, for all x ∈[0, 1], and the\nconstant function f1 is given by f1(x) = 1, for all x ∈[0, 1]. Then A contains\nP [Exercise].\n(iv) It follows immediately from (iii) above and Proposition 12.1.9 (i) that the algebra\nA in (iii) above is dense in (C[0, 1], R).\n12.2.9\nDefinitions.\nLet A be an associative algebra over F , where F is R\nor C. Let A also be a normed vector space over F with norm || ||. Then A is\na normed algebra if for all x, y ∈A, ||x · y|| ⩽||x|| ||y||.\nIf the norm || || is also complete, that is A is a Banach space, then the normed\nalgebra is called a Banach algebra.\n12.2.10\nRemark.\nit is readily seen that if A is a normed algebra, then the\nmultiplication · : A × A →A is a continuous mapping.\n12.2.11\nExample.\nFor any n ∈N, and F equal to R or C, F n with the\nnorm ||x|| = |x|, for all x ∈F , is a Banach algebra if multiplication is given by\n(x1, x2, . . . , xn)·(y1, y2, . . . , yn) = (x1y1, x2y2, . . . , xnyn), for (x1, x2, . . . , xn), (y1, y2, . . . , yn)\nF n.

Indeed, noting that\n(f ∨g)(x) = max{f(x), g(x)}\n(f ∧g)(x) = min{f(x), g(x)},\nwe see that C(X, R) is a lattice.\n382\nCHAPTER 12.\nTHE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM\nIt is clear that f(t) −ε < g(t) < f(t) + ε, for all t ∈X, which completes our\nproof.\n12.2.18\nLemma.\nLet X be any compact Hausdorff space, f ∈C(X, R)\nand |f| defined by |f|(x) = |f(x)|, for every x ∈X.\n(i) |f| ∈C(X, R);\n(ii) f ∧g = 1\n2(f + g −|f −g|), for all f, g ∈C(X, R);\n(iii) f ∨g = 1\n2(f + g + |f −g|), for all f, g ∈C(X, R);\n(iv) let A be any vector subspace of C(X, R) with the property that\nf ∈A =⇒|f| ∈A. Then A is a sublattice of C(X, R).\nProof.\nExercise\n12.2.19\nProposition.\nLet X be a compact Hausdorff space. Then every\nclosed subalgebra of C(X, R) is a closed sublattice of C(X, R).\nProof.\nLet A be a closed subalgebra of C(X, R). If f, g ∈C(X, R). By Lemma\n7.2.18 (iv) it suffices to show that f ∈A =⇒|f| ∈A.\nLet ε > 0 be given.\nFor any f ∈C(X, R), define the the closed interval\n[a, b] ⊂R, where a = −||f|| and b = ||f||.\nThe function ϕt : [a, b] →R given\nby ϕt = |t|, for t ∈[a, b] is a continuous function.\nfrom [a, b] into R.\nSo by the\nWeierstrass Theorem 12.1.5, there exists a polynomial p′ such that | |t|−p′(t) | < ε\n2 ,\nfor every t ∈[a, b].\nDefine the polynomial p by p(t) = p′(t) −p′(0), for all t ∈[a, b], and note that\n|p′(0)| < ε\n2. So we have p(0) = 0 and\n| |t| −p(t) | = | |t| −p′(t) + p′(0) | ⩽| |t| −p′(t) | + |p′(0)| < ε, for every t ∈[a, b].\nSince A is an algebra, the function p(f) ∈C(X, R), given by (p(f))(x) = p(f(x))\nfor all x ∈X, is in A. Since f(x) ∈[a, b], for all x ∈X, the previous paragraph\nimplies that | |f(x)|−p(f(x)) | < ε, for all x ∈X. So || |f|−p(f) || < ε. As p(f) ∈A\nand A is a closed set, this implies that |f| ∈A, which completes the proof.\n384\nCHAPTER 12.\nTHE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM\n12.2.22\nTheorem.\n[The (Complex) Stone-Weierstrass Theorem]\nLet X be a compact Hausdorff space and A a closed subalgebra of C(X, C)\nwhich contains a non-zero constant function. Then A = C(X, C) if and only if\nf ∈A implies the conjugate function f ∈A and A separates points of X.\nProof.\nFrom Proposition 12.2.3, if A = C(X, C), A must separate points of X\nand obviously f ∈A = C(X, C) implies the conjugate function f ∈A.\nSo we consider the converse statement. Define B to be the real-valued functions\nin A. Clearly B is a closed subalgebra of C(X, R). We claim that it suffices to prove\nthat B = C(X, R).\nThis is so, since if f ∈C(X, C), then R(f) and I(f) are in\nC(X, R) and so in B = C(X, R), and so A would be C(X, C).\nWe shall use the Real Stone-Weierstrass Theorem 12.2.20 to prove that B =\nC(X, R). Let f ∈C(X, C) seprate points of X. Then either R(f) or I(f) (or both)\nseparate points of X; so B separates points of X. Now A contains a non-constant\nfunction g.\nAs A is an algebra, the conjugate function g is also in A.\nSo the\nnon-constant real-valued function gg = |g|2 ∈B. So by the Real Stone-Weierstrass\nTheorem 12.2.20, B = C(X, R), which completes the proof.\n□\n7.2.23\nRemark.\nThe Weierstrass Approximation Theorem 12.1.5 is of course\na special case of The (Complex) Stone-Weierstrass Theorem 12.2.22. It is the case\nX = [a, b] ⊂R and A is the set of all polynomials.\n386\nCHAPTER 12.\nTHE STONE-WEIERSTRASS THEOREM\n12.2.26\nDefinition.\nLet a0, an, bn ∈C, n = 1, 2, . . . , N, N ∈N with either\naN ̸= 0 or bN ̸= 0. Then the function f : R →C given by\nf(x) = a0 +\nN\nX\nn=1\nan cos(nx) + i bn sin(nx), for x ∈R\nis is said to be a complex trignometric polynomial of degree N.\n12.2.27\nRemark.\nWe observe that if f is a real trignometric polynomial or a\ncomplex trignometric polynomial then\nf(x) = f(x + 2π) = f(x + 2kπ), for all k ∈N and x ∈R.\n(21)\nWe shall prove that every function f : R →R satisfying (21) can be approximated\nby real trignometric polynomials and every function f : R →C satisfying (21) can\nbe approximated by complex trignometric polynomials.\n12.2.29\nRemark.\nLet T denote the circle of diameter one centred at 0 in the\neuclidean space R2 with the subspace topology from R2. Of course T is a compact\nHausdorff space.\nFurther, any function f : R →R or f : R →C which satisfies\n(21) can be thought of as a function from T to R or from T to C. Further, f is a\ncontinuous function if and only if the corresponding function from T to R or C is\ncontinuous.\n12.2.30\nCorollary.\nThe algebra of all real trignometric polynomials is dense\nin C(T, R) and the algebra of all complex trignometric polynomials is dense in\nC(T, C).\nProof.\nThese results follow from The Real Stone-Weierstrass Theorem 12.2.20\nand The Complex Stone-Weierstrass Theorem 12.2.22.

(See\nLang [252], Chapter 16, Theorem 3.3.)\nIt is also worth mentioning that C(X, C) is isomorphic as a C∗-algebra to\nC(Y, C), for compact Hausdorff spaces X and Y , if and only if X is homeomorphic\nto Y . (See Lin [261], Theorem 1.3.9.)\n6The concept of a C∗-algebra has its roots in the work on quantum mechanics of Werner Karl\nHeisenberg (1901–1976), Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger (1887-1961), and John von\nNeumann (1903–1957) in the 1920s.
